  abstract = {We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based on distinguished points and substructures.             No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions.             The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred [Formula: see text] symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on [Formula: see text] symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

However, the impact produced by these systems can only be fully assessed by a lifecycle approach. This article assesses the energy used and the emissions produced and avoided in the lifecycle of a new line of the metro network in Rio de Janeiro, built as a requirement for hosting the Olympic Games in 2016. Infrastructure construction, train manufacture, maintenance, infrastructure operation and train operation were considered in the 60-year lifecycle. The study shows emission of 13.90~g~of carbon dioxide per passenger kilometer traveled during lifecycle and that non-operational emissions will be compensated 14 years after the inauguration of the system. Infrastructure construction and train operation represent most of the emissions produced and energy used. Renewable energy represents 53.27\% of total energy used. Electricity consumption has the greatest share of emissions, with 46.66\%, followed by cement and concrete, with 30.53\%, and steel, with 12.43\%. The conclusion is that the system, over the horizon analyzed, can help to reduce emissions by the city's transport system. The increase in the renewable energy share in electricity generation and the improvements in the production of cement and steel, are the key factors in reducing emissions produced during the lifecycle.},

In this study, one of the multi-criteria decision making methods, AHP, was used to determine that which of the energy consumption factors in the railways is more important. For this purpose, some methods were chosen such as increased the power level, using of regenerative energy, using of energy storage systems, speed profile optimization and efficient driving methods.

According to these criteria, the most important factor in energy reduction was obtained as the use of regenerative energy.},

The literature has revealed that the energy consumption for non-traction purposes may be of the same magnitude as the energy used to move rolling stock, and in some cases even greater. However, most of the research conducted so far has focused on the energy demand of rolling stock. This paper investigates the electricity consumption of an underground metro station using data from on-site surveys and measurements. With an average consumption of 217.64kWh/m2/year, the breakdown revealed that the lighting system dominated the underground station's energy consumption (37\%). Illuminated advertising signs were found to be responsible for 14\% of the total energy consumption, and ventilation accounted for another 14\%. The rest of the energy consumption was attributed to systems such as mobile phone signal antenna (12\%), the vertical transportation system (8\%) and small power devices (5\%). Accurate information on energy consumption for non-traction usage is useful for future implementation of energy conservation measures in underground stations, which could result in a reduction of operating costs in the long run.},

It is empirically confirmed that if the transport distance between stops is shorter than 1,800~m, the metro trains should set their maximum speeds lower than 70~km/h but higher than 30~km/h. And a shorter stop-spacing requires a lower maximum speed in this speed range to get the least costs of energy and time. The exact value of the maximum speed in this speed range ought to be further determined based on the integrated performances of the train's passenger capacity, engines, streamline body design, etc. If the transport distance is longer than 1,800~m, the generalized expense of energy and time per 10,000 passenger-kilometers decreases with the increase of the maximum speed of a train. Nevertheless, such decreases become very slow when the maximum speeds of the trains exceed 70~km/h.},

This concern explains the growth of railways over the last years as they present an inherent efficiency compared to other transport means. However, in order to further expand their role, it is necessary to optimise their energy consumption so as to increase their competitiveness. Improving railways energy efficiency requires both reliable data and modelling tools that will allow the study of different variables and alternatives. With this need in mind, this paper presents the development of consumption models based on neural networks that calculate the energy consumption of electric trains. These networks have been trained based on an extensive set of consumption data measured in line 1 of the Valencia Metro Network. Once trained, the neural networks provide a reliable estimation of the vehicles consumption along a specific route when fed with input data such as train speed, acceleration or track longitudinal slope. These networks represent a useful modelling tool that may allow a deeper study of railway lines in terms of energy expenditure with the objective of reducing the costs and environmental impact associated to railways.},

However, the high energy consumption of daily operations is an emerging issue due to increased rail transit networks and passenger demands. Thus, reducing the energy consumption and operational cost by using advanced optimization methodologies is an urgent task for operation managers. This work systematically introduces energy-saving approaches for urban rail transit systems in three aspects, namely, train speed profile optimization, utilization of regenerative energy, and integrated optimization of train timetable and speed profile. Future research directions in this field are also proposed to meet increasing passenger demands and network-based urban rail transit systems.},

  abstract = {There is increasing interest in the potential of urban rail to reduce the impact of metropolitan transportation due to its high capacity, reliability and absence of local emissions. However, in a context characterised by increasing capacity demands and rising energy costs, and where other transport modes are considerably improving their environmental performance, urban rail must minimise its energy use without affecting its service quality. Urban rail energy consumption is defined by a wide range of interdependent factors; therefore, a system wide perspective is required, rather than focusing on energy savings at subsystem level. This paper contributes to the current literature by proposing an holistic approach to reduce the overall energy consumption of urban rail. Firstly, a general description of this transport mode is given, which includes an assessment of its typical energy breakdown. Secondly, a comprehensive appraisal of the main practices, strategies and technologies currently available to minimise its energy use is provided. These comprise: regenerative braking, energy-efficient driving, traction losses reduction, comfort functions optimisation, energy metering, smart power management and renewable energy micro-generation. Finally, a clear, logical methodology is described to optimally define and implement energy saving schemes in urban rail systems. This includes general guidelines for a qualitative assessment and comparison of measures alongside a discussion on the principal interdependences between them. As a hypothetical example of application, the paper concludes that the energy consumption in existing urban rail systems could be reduced by approximately 25\textendash 35\% through the implementation of energy-optimised timetables, energy-efficient driving strategies, improved control of comfort functions in vehicles and wayside energy storage devices.},

However, given the complexity of such systems, this can only be effectively achieved through a holistic approach which considers the numerous interdependences between subsystems (i.e. vehicles, operations and infrastructure). Such an approach requires a comprehensive set of energy consumption-related Key Performance Indicators (KEPIs) that enable: a multilevel analysis of the actual energy performance of the system; an assessment of potential energy saving strategies; and the monitoring of the results of implemented measures. This paper proposes an original, complete list of KEPIs developed through a scientific approach validated by different stakeholders. It consists of a hierarchical list of 22 indicators divided into two levels: 10 key performance indicators, to ascertain the performance of the whole system and complete subsystems; and 12 performance indicators, to evaluate the performance of single units within subsystems, for example, a single rail vehicle or station. Additionally, the paper gives a brief insight into urban rail energy usage by providing an adequate context in which to understand the proposed KEPIs, together with a methodology describing their application when optimising the energy consumption of urban rail systems.},

This paper proposes an analysis by modeling and simulation of a train in order to evaluate the behavior of the DC link voltage supply applied to six stations. The storage kinetic energy of the metropolitan rail trains during accelerations is normally burned in order to avoid DC link perturbation voltage. However this energy can be recovered and used to compensate the DC link voltage variations, which can help to save an important amount of energy and improve the overall performance of the system. So, in this paper is proposed a Voltage Compensation System (VCS) throughout an energy storage system. Finally, an evaluation of the saved energy and a better performance operation of the metropolitan railways can be demonstrated with the results obtained.},

  abstract = {This paper is aimed at developing a rail transit route optimization model (RTROM) for cost-effective and sustainable rail infrastructure planning and design. Locations of rail transit routes and stations depend on many factors, including potential ridership, costs of land, construction and operation, land use, connecting routes, passenger travel times, and environmental impacts. Suitably located rail transit routes effectively serve the potential demand while also minimizing costs and environmental impacts. Thus, a common problem in all rail infrastructure planning and design projects is to identify the best possible route that satisfies design constraints (such as minimum radius, maximum gradient, and vertical clearance), geographical considerations (such as demand generators and socio-economically sensitive areas) and objectives (such as minimization of associated costs and environmental impacts, or maximization of net benefits). The developed RTROM uses a genetic algorithm for performing optimization, which is integrated to a geographic information system for seamless transfer of land-use, environmental, and topographic data during the optimal search process. The model is tested in a real-world case study from Saint Andrews, Scotland. The lessons learned from the real-world application of the model are discussed. Many extensions of the model remain to be tested in future works.},

A deterministic simulation model is developed and used to analyze train motion and energy use for three different vertical alignments. To minimize the cost of rail transit operation for both directions, cruising speed is optimized as a decision variable while train operations are simulated on the proposed vertical alignments. The numerical analysis and sensitivity studies show that the developed deterministic simulation model is useful for comparing vertical alignments, and that the proposed alignment concepts can significantly reduce travel time, energy use, brake wear, operating cost, and total cost compared with the baseline alignment profile.},

Since the electrical consumption of stations is a major factor in the planning of infrastructure, a good prediction of the electrical consumption will greatly assist in the design of the station infrastructure. This study develops an intelligent approach to predict the energy consumption of railway stations. Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP) is adopted to mimic the non-linear correlation between energy consumption, the spatial design of the station, meteorological factors and also the usage of the 19 stations selected. Coefficient of correlation is obtained between the MLP predicted results and the actual collected data to evaluate the performance of the prediction. We apply statistical approach to assess the performance of the developed MLP model. It shows that minimum coefficient of correlation is 0.96 with a 95\% confidence level which is considered sufficient for engineering application. This approach is also adopted to predict the profile of the weekly electrical consumption of a selected station. The predicted profile reasonably agrees with that of the actual consumption. This study develops a useful tool to estimate the electrical power consumption of new MTR stations.},

A comparative analysis of GHG emissions of different urban rail transit systems around the world is also provided.

Although the traction emissions per passenger-km traveled of Shanghai Metro are competitive at the global level, there is still great energy-saving potential in the operation phase, especially in ornately designed train stations. The preliminary conclusions of this study may help shed light on the emission reduction potential of urban rail transit systems and the emission reduction targets in China and serve as a source of information and data for future LCAs.},

This paper is a systematic analysis of the dynamics and dimensions of this unprecedented decline. Using transit demand data derived from a widely used transit navigation app, we fit logistic functions to model the decline in daily demand and derive key parameters: base value, the apparent minimal level of demand and cliff and base points, representing the initial date when transit demand decline began and the final date when the decline rate attenuated. Regression analyses reveal that communities with higher proportions of essential workers, vulnerable populations (African American, Hispanic, Female, and people over 45 years old), and more coronavirus Google searches tend to maintain higher levels of minimal demand during COVID-19. Approximately half of the agencies experienced their decline before the local spread of COVID-19 likely began; most of these are in the US Midwest. Almost no transit systems finished their decline periods before local community spread. We also compare hourly demand profiles for each system before and during COVID-19 using ordinary Procrustes distance analysis. The results show substantial departures from typical weekday hourly demand profiles. Our results provide insights into public transit as an essential service during a pandemic.},

The simulation results and the measured data are consistent in the trend of change, but there is a certain difference in corresponding values (fluctuated in an acceptable range), which verifies the validity of the model.

In order to achieve this objective different strategies can be applied, normally focused into rolling stock, infrastructure and/or operation. Considering short-term measures and related to the traffic operation strategies, different approaches are being researched. One of the most effective strategy which reduce net energy consumption is the use of efficient driving techniques. These techniques produce a speed profile between two stations that requires the minimum net energy consumption, without degrading commercial running times or passenger comfort. In this paper, a computer model for calculating the metro vehicles speed profiles minimizing the energy consumption was developed. The equations considered in the model represent the behavior of a single vehicle operated under manual driving, subject to different constraints such as the headway, cycle time, distances and acceleration limits. The proposed model calculates different commands to be systematically executed by the driver. The resulting simulator has been tuned by means of on board measurements of speed, accelerations and energy consumption obtained along different lines in Metro de Valencia network. For this purpose, different scenarios are analyzed to assess the achievable energy savings. In general terms and comparing with the actual energy consumption, the solutions proposed can reduce the net energy consumption around 19\%.},

These are essential for the introduction of automatic processes of an optimized traffic planning, the optimal use of infrastructure capacity and energy, and, overall, the introduction of data-driven approaches into rail operation. Train trajectories collection constitutes a primary source of information for offline procedures such as timetable generation, driving behaviour analysis and models' calibration. Unfortunately, current train trajectory data are often affected by measurement errors, missing data and, in many cases, incongruence between dependent variables. To overcome this problem, a trajectory reconstruction problem must be solved, before using trajectories for any further purpose. In the present paper, a new hybrid stochastic trajectory reconstruction is proposed. On-board monitoring data on train position and velocity (kinematics) are combined with data on power used for traction and feasible acceleration values (dynamics). A fusion of those two types of information is performed by considering the stochastic characteristics of the data, via smoothing techniques. A promising potential use is seen especially in those cases where information on continuous train positions is not available or unreliable (e.g. tunnels, canyons, etc.).},

Classical research has studied the energy-efficient operational strategy and the energy-efficient system design separately to reduce the traction energy consumption. This paper aims to combine the operational strategies and the system design by analyzing how the infrastructure and vehicle parameters of metro systems influence the operational traction energy consumption. Firstly, a solution approach to the optimal train control model is introduced, which is used to design the Optimal Train Control Simulator(OTCS). Then, based on the OTCS, the performance of some important energy-efficient system design strategies is investigated to reduce the trains' traction energy consumption, including reduction of the train mass, improvement of the kinematic resistance, the design of the energy-saving gradient, increasing the maximum traction and braking forces, introducing regenerative braking and timetable optimization. As for these energy-efficient strategies, the performances are finally evaluated using the OTCS with the practical operational data of the Beijing Yizhuang metro line. The proposed approach gives an example to quantitatively analyze the energy reduction of different strategies in the system design procedure, which may help the decision makers to have an overview of the energy-efficient performances and then to make decisions by balancing the costs and the benefits.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.}

The model is calibrated with data from Portland, Oregon using an unconstrained non-linear optimization procedure, and validated using data from Chicago, Illinois by comparing model predictions against the National Transit Database (NTD) estimates. The results demonstrate that regenerative braking efficiency varies as an exponential function of the deceleration level, rather than an average constant as assumed in previous studies. The model predictions are demonstrated to be consistent with the NTD estimates, producing a predicted error of 1.87\% and -2.31\%. The paper demonstrates that energy recovery reduces the overall power consumption by 20\% for the tested Chicago route. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that the proposed modeling approach is able to capture energy consumption differences associated with train, route and operational parameters, and thus is applicable for project-level analysis. The model can be easily implemented in traffic simulation software, used in smartphone applications and eco-transit programs given its fast execution time and easy integration in complex frameworks.},

  abstract = {A door-to-door trip may involve multiple traffic modes. For example, travelers may drive to a subway station and make a transfer to rail transit; alternatively, people may also start their trips by walking/cycling to a bus/subway station and then take transit in most of the trip. A successful eco-route planning thus should be able to cover multiple traffic modes and offer intermodal routing suggestions. Developing such a system requires to address extensive concerns. The dissertation is a building block of the multi-modal energy-efficient routing system which is being developed and tested in the simulation environment before real applications. Four submodules have been developed in the dissertation as partial fulfillment of the simulation-based system: energy consumption modeling, subway system development, on-road vehicles dynamic eco-routing, and information effect on route choice behavior. Other submodules such as pedestrian/bicycle modeling will be studied in the future.  Towards the research goal, the dissertation first develops fuel consumption models for on-road vehicles. Given that gasoline light duty vehicles (LDVs) and electric vehicles were modeled in previous studies, the research effort mainly focuses on heavy duty vehicles (HDVs). Specifically, heavy duty diesel trucks (HDDTs) as well as diesel and hybrid-electric transit buses are modeled. The models are developed based on the Virginia Tech Comprehensive Power-based Fuel consumption Modeling (VT-CPFM) framework. The results demonstrate that the model estimates are highly consistent with field observations as well as the estimates of the Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model (CMEM) and MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES). It is also found that the optimum fuel economy cruise speed ranges between 32 and 52 km/h for the tested trucks and between 39 and 47 km/h for the tested buses on grades varying from 0\% to 8\%, which is significantly lower than LDVs (60-80 km/h).  The dissertation then models electric train dynamics and energy consumption in support of subway simulation system development and trip energy estimation. The dynamics model varies throttle and brake level with running speed rather than assuming constants as was done by previous studies, and the energy consumption model considers instantaneous energy regeneration. Both models can be easily calibrated using non-engine data and implemented in simulation systems and eco-transit applications. The results of the dynamics modeling demonstrate that the proposed model can adequately capture instantaneous acceleration/deceleration behavior and thus produce realistic train trajectories. The results of the energy consumption modeling demonstrate that the model produces the estimates consistent with the National Transit Database (NTD) results, and is applicable for project-level analysis given its ability in capturing the energy consumption differences associated with train, route and operational characteristics.  The most suitable simulation testbed for system development is then identified. The dissertation investigates four state-of-the-art microsimulation models (INTEGRATION, VISSIM, AIMSUM, PARAMICS). Given that the car-following model within a micro-simulator controls longitudinal vehicle motion and thus determines the resulting vehicle trajectories, the research effort mainly focuses on the performance of the built-in car-following models from the energy and environmental perspective. The vehicle specific power (VSP) distributions resulting from each of the car-following models are compared to the field observations. The results demonstrate that the Rakha-Pasumarthy-Adjerid (RPA) model (implemented in the INTEGRATION software) outperforms the Gipps (AIMSUM), Fritzsche (PARAMICS) and Wiedemann (VISSIM) models in generating accurate VSP distributions and fuel consumption and emission estimates. This demonstrates the advantage of the INTEGRATION model over the other three simulation models for energy and environmental analysis.  A new eco-routing model, comprehensively considering microscopic characteristics, is then developed, followed by a numerical experiment to test the benefit of the model. With the resulting eco-routing model, an on-road vehicle dynamic eco-routing system is constructed for in-vehicle navigation applications, and tested for different congestion levels. The results of the study demonstrate that the proposed eco-routing model is able to generate reasonable routing suggestions based on real-time information while at the same time differentiate eco-routes between vehicle models. It is also found that the proposed dynamic eco-routing system achieves lower network-wide energy consumption levels compared to the traditional eco-routing and travel time routing at all congestion levels. The results also demonstrate that the conventional fuel savings relative to the travel time routing decrease with the increasing congestion level; however, the electric power savings do not monotonically vary with congestion level. Furthermore, the energy savings relative to the traditional eco-routing are also not monotonically related to congestion level. In addition, network configuration is demonstrated to significantly affect eco-routing benefits.  The dissertation finally investigates the potential to influence driver behavior by studying the impact of information on route choice behavior based on a real world experiment. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the effectiveness of information in routing rationality depends upon the traveler's age, preferences, route characteristics, and information type. Specifically, information effect is less evident for elder travelers. Also, the provided information may not be contributing if travelers value other considerations or one route significantly outperforms the others. The results also demonstrate that, when travelers have limited experiences, strict information is more effective than variability information, and that the faster less reliable route is more attractive than the slower more reliable route; yet the difference becomes insignificant with experiences accumulation. The results of the study will be used to enhance system design through considering route choice incentives.},

  abstract = {The paper develops a continuous rail transit simulator (RailSIM) intended for multi-modal energy-efficient routing applications. RailSIM integrates sophisticated train dynamics and energy models to replicate train motion and energy consumption behavior, respectively. The simulator is calibrated using an off-line optimization procedure to match preprogramed railway schedules by optimizing three model parameters, namely; the segment target speed, the average deceleration level, and the brake force adjustment factor. The objective of the calibration procedure is to match the simulated and actual average running speed for each station-to-station pair. Upon calibration, RailSIM is applied to the Greater Los Angeles area and validated at both the instantaneous and aggregated levels. Results demonstrate that RailSIM is able to produce realistic train dynamics and energy consumption estimates producing a comfortable ride while simultaneously matching the railway schedule. RailSIM is also demonstrated to capture the impact of track gradient on energy outputs. The results also indicate that a perfect match to empirical energy estimates is achieved at an average grade of 1.8\%, which is a reasonable approximation of the average track gradient of the testing area. The sensitivity of RailSIM to some of the metro rail parameters is also discussed to account for its applicability to rail transit systems in other cities. Finally, a pilot test of RailSIM implementation in the higher-level multi-modal eco-routing system is performed to demonstrate RailSIM's feasibility of supporting energy-efficient travel.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has had drastic impacts on urban economies and activities, with transit systems around the world witnessing an unprecedented decline in ridership. This paper attempts to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on the daily ridership of urban rail transit (URT) using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM). Six variables are selected as the predictors, among which four variables unaffected by the pandemic are employed. A total of 22 cities from Asia, Europe, and the US with varying timelines of the pandemic outbreak are selected in this study. The effect of COVID-19 on the URT ridership in 11 cities in Asia is investigated using the difference between their observed ridership reduction and the potential ridership generated by the other 11 cities. Additionally, the effect of the system closure in Wuhan on ridership recovery is analyzed. A series of placebo tests are rolled out to confirm the significance of these analyses. Two traditional methods (causal impact analysis and straightforward analysis) are employed to illustrate the usefulness of the SCM. Most Chinese cities experienced about a 90\% reduction in ridership with some variation among different cities. Seoul and Singapore experienced a minor decrease compared to Chinese cities. The results suggest that URT ridership reductions are associated with the severity and duration of restrictions and lockdowns. Full system closure can have severe impacts on the speed of ridership recovery following resumption of service, as demonstrated in the case of Wuhan with about 22\% slower recovery. The results of this study can provide support for policymakers to monitor the URT ridership during the recovery period and understand the likely effects of system closure if considered in future emergency events.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of rail transit, a vast amount of electric power is consumed each year. However, the generation of electricity, and especially coal power generation, is an important source of greenhouse gases. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the potential of carbon emission reduction of urban rail transit based on specific electricity consumption structures. In this study, 18 cities in China were taken as the research object, and backward analysis was used to analyze the proportion limit of coal power consumption for rail transit in each city under three scenarios from 2015 to 2017. By comparing the limit value with the actual coal power consumed by urban rail transit, we analyzed the potential carbon emission reduction of rail transit relative to other traffic modes. The study results supported several conclusions. First, the traffic demand is in direct proportion to the carbon emission reduction potential in rail transit. Second, for cities with high coal power consumption, the development of ground bus transit is more conducive to achieving carbon reduction targets compared with rail transit. Finally, promoting the development of rail transit technology and lowering the energy consumption per capita unit travel distance are the fundamental ways to increase the emission reduction potential of rail transit. Therefore, as a modern transportation tool, rail transit is not an absolute emission reduction advantage for all cities. A city needs to analyze its own resource structure and travel demand together, set up suitable traffic modes to realize green growth and sustainable development.},
