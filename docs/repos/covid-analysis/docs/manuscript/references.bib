  abstract = {Unlike most countries, Korea did not implement a lockdown in its battle against COVID-19, instead successfully relying on testing and contact tracing. Only one region, Daegu-Gyeongbuk (DG), had a significant number of infections, traced to a religious sect. This allows us to estimate the causal effect of the outbreak on the labor market using difference-in-differences. We find that a one per thousand increase in infections causes a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment. Noncausal estimates of this coefficient from the US and UK, which implemented large-scale lockdowns, range from 5 to 6 percent, suggesting that at most half of the job losses in the US and UK can be attributed to lockdowns. We also find that employment losses caused by local outbreaks in the absence of lockdowns are (i) mainly due to reduced hiring by small establishments, (ii) concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, and (iii) worst for the economically vulnerable workers who are less educated, young, in low-wage occupations, and on temporary contracts, even controlling for industry effects. All these patterns are similar to what we observe in the US and UK: The unequal effects of COVID-19 are the same with or without lockdowns. Our finding suggests that the lifting of lockdowns in the US and UK may lead to only modest recoveries in employment unless COVID-19 infection rates fall.},

  abstract = {We construct a quantitative model of an economy hit by an epidemic. People differ by age and skill, and choose occupations and whether to commute to work or work from home, to maximize their income and minimize their fear of infection. Occupations differ by wage, infection risk, and the productivity loss when working from home. By setting the model parameters to replicate the progression of COVID-19 in South Korea and the United Kingdom, we obtain three key results. First, government-imposed lock-downs may not present a clear trade-off between GDP and public health, as commonly believed, even though its immediate effect is to reduce GDP and infections by forcing people to work from home. A premature lifting of the lock-down raises GDP temporarily, but infections rise over the next months to a level at which many people choose to work from home, where they are less productive, driven by the fear of infection. A longer lockdown eventually mitigates the GDP loss as well as flattens the infection curve. Second, if the UK had adopted South Korean policies, its GDP loss and infections would have been substantially smaller both in the short and the long run. This is not because Korea implemented policies sooner, but because aggressive testing and tracking more effectively reduce infections and disrupt the economy less than a blanket lock-down. Finally, low-skill workers and self-employed lose the most from the epidemic and also from the government policies. However, the policy of issuing ``visas'' to those who have antibodies will disproportionately benefit the low-skilled, by relieving them of the fear of infection and also by allowing them to get back to work.},

During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Z\"urich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0{$\cdot$}7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35\textendash 63\% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9\textendash 12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA.

We model the change in mobility as an exogenous shock similar to a natural disaster. We identify two ways through which mobility restrictions affect Italian citizens. First, we find that the impact of lockdown is stronger in municipalities with higher fiscal capacity. Second, we find evidence of a segregation effect, since mobility contraction is stronger in municipalities in which inequality is higher and for those where individuals have lower income per capita. Our results highlight both the social costs of lockdown and a challenge of unprecedented intensity: On the one hand, the crisis is inducing a sharp reduction of fiscal revenues for both national and local governments; on the other hand, a significant fiscal effort is needed to sustain the most fragile individuals and to mitigate the increase in poverty and inequality induced by the lockdown.},

  abstract = {Background Patients undergoing continuous vital sign monitoring (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], pulse oximetry [SpO2]) in real time display inter-related vital sign changes during situations of physiologic stress. Patterns in this physiological cross-talk could portend impending cardiorespiratory instability (CRI). Vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling with Granger causality tests is one of the most flexible ways to elucidate underlying causal mechanisms in time series data. Purpose The purpose of this article is to illustrate development of patient-specific VAR models using vital sign time series (VSTS) data in a sample of acutely ill, monitored, step-down unit (SDU) patients, and determine their Granger causal dynamics prior to onset of an incident CRI. Approach CRI was defined as vital signs beyond stipulated normality thresholds (HR = 40\textendash 140/minute, RR = 8\textendash 36/minute, SpO2 {$<$} 85\%) and persisting for 3 minutes within a 5-minute moving window (60\% of the duration of the window). A 6-hour time segment prior to onset of first CRI was chosen for time series modeling in 20 patients using a six-step procedure: (a) the uniform time series for each vital sign was assessed for stationarity; (b) appropriate lag was determined using a lag-length selection criteria; (c) the VAR model was constructed; (d) residual autocorrelation was assessed with the Lagrange Multiplier test; (e) stability of the VAR system was checked; and (f) Granger causality was evaluated in the final stable model. Results The primary cause of incident CRI was low SpO2 (60\% of cases), followed by out-of-range RR (30\%) and HR (10\%). Granger causality testing revealed that change in RR caused change in HR (21\%) (i.e., RR changed before HR changed) more often than change in HR causing change in RR (15\%). Similarly, changes in RR caused changes in SpO2 (15\%) more often than changes in SpO2 caused changes in RR (9\%). For HR and SpO2, changes in HR causing changes in SpO2 and changes in SpO2 causing changes in HR occurred with equal frequency (18\%). Discussion Within this sample of acutely ill patients who experienced a CRI event, VAR modeling indicated that RR changes tend to occur before changes in HR and SpO2. These findings suggest that contextual assessment of RR changes as the earliest sign of CRI is warranted. Use of VAR modeling may be helpful in other nursing research applications based on time series data.},

  abstract = {To limit the spread of Covid-19, most countries in the world have put in place measures which restrict mobility. The co-presence of several people in the same place of work, shopping, leisure, or transport is considered a favourable vector for the transmission of the virus. However, this hypothesis remains to be verified in the light of the daily data available since the first wave of contamination. Does immobility reduce the spread of Covid-19 pandemics? Does mobility contribute to the increase in the number of infections for all activities? This paper applies several Pooled Mean Group\textendash Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PMG-ARDL) models to investigate the impact of immobility and daily mobility activities on the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in the European countries using daily data for the period 12 March 2020 to 31 August 2021. The results of the PMG-ARDL models show that immobility and higher temperatures play a significant role in reducing the Covid-19 pandemic. The increase in mobility activities (grocery, retail, use of transit) is also positively associated with the number of new Covid-19 cases. The combined analysis with the Granger test shows that the relationship between mobility and Covid-19 goes in both directions, with the exception of grocery shopping, visits to parks and commuting mobility. The former favours the spread of Covid-19, while the next two has no causal relationship with Covid-19. The results confirm the role of immobility in mitigating the spread of the pandemic, but call into question the drastic policies of systematically closing all places of activity.},

Most states have implemented similar NPIs at similar time points. However, it is likely different countries and populations respond differently to the NPIs and that these differences cause mobility patterns and thereby the epidemic development to change. Methods We build a Bayesian model that estimates the number of deaths on a given day dependent on changes in the basic reproductive number, R0, due to differences in mobility patterns. We utilise mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model. Findings The changes in mobility have a considerable overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The shift in mobility in all categories shows high correlations with the death rates 1 month later. Reduction of movement within the grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for most of the decrease in R0. Interpretation Our model predicts 3-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium. We also note that the exponential nature of all epidemiological models based on the basic reproductive number, R0 cause small errors to have extensive effects on the predicted outcome.},

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic.                                         Methods:               Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case.                                         Results:               The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p{$<$}0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate.

  abstract = {Starting from December 2019 the world has faced an unprecedented health crisis caused by the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) due to the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Within this topic, the aim of the paper was to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results showed that mobility habits represent one of the variables that explains the number of COVID-19 infections jointly with the number of tests/day and some environmental variables (i.e. PM pollution and temperature). Nevertheless, a proximity variable to the first outbreak was also significant, meaning that the areas close to the outbreak had a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial stage of infection (time-decay phenomena). Furthermore, the number of daily new cases was related to the trips performed three weeks before. This threshold of 21\,days could be considered as a sort of positivity detection time, meaning that the mobility restrictions quarantine commonly set at 14\,days, defined only according to incubation-based epidemiological considerations, is underestimated (possible delays between contagion and detection) as a containment policy and may not always contribute to effectively slowing down the spread of virus worldwide. This result is original and, if confirmed in other studies, will lay the groundwork for more effective containment of COVID-19 in countries that are still in the health emergency, as well as for possible future returns of the virus.},

Here we introduce a metapopulation susceptible\textendash exposed\textendash infectious\textendash removed (SEIR) model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ten of the largest US metropolitan areas. Our mobility networks are derived from mobile phone data and map the hourly movements of 98 million people from neighbourhoods (or census block groups) to points of interest such as restaurants and religious establishments, connecting 56,945 census block groups to 552,758 points of interest with 5.4 billion hourly edges. We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in the behaviour of the population over time. Our model predicts that a small minority of `superspreader' points of interest account for a large majority of the infections, and that restricting the maximum occupancy at each point of interest is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our model also correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups2\textendash 8 solely as the result of differences in mobility: we find that disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce their mobility as sharply, and that the points of interest that they visit are more crowded and are therefore associated with higher risk. By capturing who is infected at which locations, our model supports detailed analyses that can inform more-effective and equitable policy responses to COVID-19.}

To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic. Science, this issue p. 395 Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80\% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90\% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50\% or higher reduction of transmission in the community. A SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological model reveals the effects of travel restrictions and transmission reduction efforts on the spread of this novel virus.

  abstract = {To date, non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) have been the mainstay for controlling the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While NPIs are effective in preventing health systems overload, these long-term measures are likely to have significant adverse economic consequences. Therefore, many countries are currently considering to lift the NPIs\textemdash increasing the~likelihood of disease resurgence.~In this regard, dynamic NPIs, with intervals of relaxed social distancing, may provide a more suitable alternative. However, the ideal frequency and duration of intermittent NPIs, and the ideal ``break'' when interventions can be temporarily relaxed, remain uncertain, especially in resource-poor settings. We employed a multivariate prediction model, based on up-to-date transmission and clinical~parameters, to simulate outbreak trajectories in 16 countries, from diverse regions and economic categories. In each country, we then modelled the impacts on intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths over an 18-month period for following scenarios: (1) no intervention, (2) consecutive cycles of mitigation measures followed by a relaxation period, and (3) consecutive cycles of suppression measures followed by a relaxation period. We defined these dynamic interventions based on reduction of the mean reproduction number during each cycle, assuming a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2 for no intervention, and subsequent~effective reproduction numbers (R) of 0.8 and 0.5 for illustrative~dynamic mitigation and suppression interventions, respectively. We found that dynamic cycles of 50-day mitigation followed by a 30-day relaxation reduced transmission, however, were unsuccessful in lowering ICU hospitalizations below manageable limits. By contrast, dynamic cycles of 50-day suppression followed by a 30-day relaxation kept the ICU demands below the national capacities. Additionally, we estimated that a significant number of new infections and deaths, especially in resource-poor countries, would be averted if these dynamic suppression measures were kept in place over an 18-month period. This multi-country analysis demonstrates that intermittent reductions of R below 1 through a potential combination of suppression interventions and relaxation can be an effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control. Such a ``schedule'' of social distancing might be particularly relevant to low-income countries, where a single, prolonged suppression intervention is unsustainable. Efficient implementation of dynamic suppression interventions, therefore, confers a pragmatic option to: (1) prevent critical care overload and deaths, (2) gain time to develop preventive and clinical measures, and (3) reduce economic hardship globally.},

We find that forecasts can be improved by employing a global framework and hierarchical priors which induce country-specific degrees of shrinkage on the coefficients of the GVAR model.

It advances research in this area in a number of directions. In particular, it provides a theoretical framework where the GVAR is derived as an approximation to a global unobserved common factor model. Using average pair-wise cross-section error correlations, the GVAR approach is shown to be quite effective in dealing with the common factor interdependencies and international co-movements of business cycles. It develops a sieve bootstrap procedure for simulation of the GVAR as a whole, which is then used in testing the structural stability of the parameters, and for establishing bootstrap confidence bounds for the impulse responses. Finally, in addition to generalized impulse responses, the current paper considers the use of the GVAR for `structural' impulse response analysis with focus on external shocks for the euro area economy, particularly in response to shocks to the US.

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number \$\$\{R\}\_\{t\}\$\$Rt below 1 (probability \$\$\{R\}\_\{t\}\textbackslash,\$\$Rt{$<$} 1.0 is 99.9\%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2\% and 4.0\% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.},

Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society, but their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2\textendash 4. Here, we compile new data on 1,717 local, regional, and national non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 38\% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these six countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting roughly 530 million total infections. These findings may help inform whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified, or lifted, and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 has been reported7.},

The rapid spread of the virus at a global scale highlights the need for a more harmonized, less privacy-concerning, easily accessible approach to monitoring the human mobility that has proven to be associated with viral transmission. In this study, we analyzed over 580 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated information at the global, country, and U.S. state scale. Considering the multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness in certain geographic regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amenable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March 11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have obviously affected people's travel routines. The country scale comparisons reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation measures, proving that Twitter-based mobility implies the effectiveness of those measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is distinct. However, the impacts vary substantially among states.},

The rich data from the Open COVID-19 Data Working Group include the dates when people first reported symptoms, not just a positive test date. Using these data and real-time travel data from the internet services company Baidu, Kraemer et al. found that mobility statistics offered a precise record of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among the cities of China at the start of 2020. The frequency of introductions from Wuhan were predictive of the size of the epidemic sparked in other provinces. However, once the virus had escaped Wuhan, strict local control measures such as social isolation and hygiene, rather than long-distance travel restrictions, played the largest part in controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread. Science, this issue p. 493 The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions were undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Mobile phone data show that the spread of COVID-19 in China was driven by travel and mitigated substantially by local control measures.

Simulating COVID-19 evolution in two full-scale cities with representative synthetic populations and mobility patterns, we analyze activity-based contact networks. We observe that transit contacts are scale-free in both cities, work contacts are Weibull distributed, and shopping or leisure contacts are exponentially distributed. We also investigate the impact of the transit network, finding that its removal dampens disease propagation, while work is also critical to post-peak disease spreading. Our framework, validated against existing case and mortality data, demonstrates the potential for tracking and tracing, along with detailed socio-demographic and mobility analyses of epidemic control strategies.},

In macroeconomic analysis the term `variance decomposition' or, more precisely, `forecast error variance decomposition' is used more narrowly for a specific tool for interpreting the relations between variables described by vector autoregressive (VAR) models. These models were advocated by Sims (1980) and used since then by many economists and econometricians as alternatives to classical simultaneous equations models. Sims criticized the way the latter models were specified, and questioned in particular the exogeneity assumptions common in simultaneous equations modelling.},

As schools and businesses shuttered, the mobility of these people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns emerged that varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations, specifically focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns. We show that people's activity response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within them.

Questions exist regarding the suitability and validity of these sources. Aim We conducted a systematic review to identify the sources of airline passenger data used for these purposes and to assess validation of the data and reproducibility of the methodology. Methods Articles matching our search criteria and describing a model of the international spread of human infectious disease, parameterised with airline passenger data, were identified. Information regarding type and source of airline passenger data used was collated and the studies' reproducibility assessed. Results We identified 136 articles. The majority (n\,=\,96) sourced data primarily used by the airline industry. Governmental data sources were used in 30 studies and data published by individual airports in four studies. Validation of passenger data was conducted in only seven studies. No study was found to be fully reproducible, although eight were partially reproducible. Limitations By limiting the articles to international spread, articles focussed on within-country transmission even if they used relevant data sources were excluded. Authors were not contacted to clarify their methods. Searches were limited to articles in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Conclusion We recommend greater efforts to assess validity and biases of airline passenger data used for modelling studies, particularly when model outputs are to inform national and international public health policies. We also recommend improving reporting standards and more detailed studies on biases in commercial and open-access data to assess their reproducibility.},

I stress, in particular, the importance of countries' interconnections to understand the spread of the virus. I estimate a global VAR model and exploit a dataset on existing social connections across country borders. I show that social networks help explain not only the spread of the disease but also cross-country spillovers in perceptions about coronavirus risk and in social distancing behavior. In the early phases of the pandemic, perceptions of coronavirus risk in most countries are affected by pandemic shocks originating in Italy. Later, the USA, Spain, and the UK play sizable roles. Social distancing responses to domestic and global health shocks are heterogeneous; however, they almost always exhibit delays and sluggish adjustments. Unemployment responses vary widely across countries. Unemployment is particularly responsive to health shocks in the USA and Spain, while unemployment fluctuFations are attenuated almost everywhere else.},

  abstract = {Vector autoregression (VAR) is a fundamental tool for modeling multivariate time series. However, as the number of component series is increased, the VAR model becomes overparameterized. Several authors have addressed this issue by incorporating regularized approaches, such as the lasso in VAR estimation. Traditional approaches address overparameterization by selecting a low lag order, based on the assumption of short range dependence, assuming that a universal lag order applies to all components. Such an approach constrains the relationship between the components and impedes forecast performance. The lasso-based approaches perform much better in high-dimensional situations but do not incorporate the notion of lag order selection. We propose a new class of hierarchical lag structures (HLag) that embed the notion of lag selection into a convex regularizer. The key modeling tool is a group lasso with nested groups which guarantees that the sparsity pattern of lag coefficients honors the VAR's ordered structure. The proposed HLag framework offers three basic structures, which allow for varying levels of flexibility, with many possible generalizations. A simulation study demonstrates improved performance in forecasting and lag order selection over previous approaches, and macroeconomic, financial, and energy applications further highlight forecasting improvements as well as HLag's convenient, interpretable output.},

Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73\% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80\% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48\%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27\textendash 77\%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74\% (IQR across countries [49\textendash 91\%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30\% (IQR across countries [12\textendash 48\%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.},

This paper represents a hybrid method for predicting multivariate workload based on the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and the Stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. In the proposed method, two metrics are used: CPU and memory usage, the VAR model is used to filter the linear interdependencies among the multivariate time series, and the stacked LSTM model to capture nonlinear trends in the residuals computed from the VAR model. The proposed hybrid model is compared with other hybrid predictive models: the ARMLP model, the RNN-GRU model and the ARIMA-LSTM model. Results of experiments show superior efficacy of the proposed method over the other hybrid models.},

Individual region-specific vector error-correcting models are estimated in which the domestic variables are related to corresponding foreign variables constructed exclusively to match the international trade pattern of the country under consideration. The individual country models are then linked in a consistent and cohesive manner to generate forecasts for all of the variables in the world economy simultaneously. The global model is estimated for 25 countries grouped into 11 regions using quarterly data over 1979Q1\textendash 1999Q1. The degree of regional interdependencies is investigated via generalized impulse responses where the effects of shocks to a given variable in a given country on the rest of the world are provided.

Forecasts are obtained for 134 variables from 26 regions, which are made up of 33 countries and cover about 90\% of the world output. The forecasts are compared to typical benchmarks: univariate autoregressive and random walk models. Building on the forecast combination literature, the effects of model and estimation uncertainty on forecast outcomes are examined by pooling forecasts obtained from different GVAR models estimated over alternative sample periods. Given the size of the modelling problem, and the heterogeneity of the economies considered\textendash industrialised, emerging, and less developed countries\textendash as well as the very real likelihood of possibly multiple structural breaks, averaging forecasts across both models and windows makes a significant difference.

@misc{russia,
  title = {Russia's {{Response}} to {{Covid-19}}},
  abstract = {Although delayed compared to outbreaks in other countries, the Covid-19 pandemic has taken hold in Russia. Faced with a somewhat haphazard federal response, regional governments have pursued varying strategies for combating the virus. Russia has also provided aid to several foreign countries, which has led to accusations that it is using aid for propaganda purposes. The eventual severity of the outbreak in Russia and the impact of the steps taken by Moscow and regional governments is yet to be fully known, but despite the virus appearing comparatively late, it is now clear that the disease is spreading rapidly across Russia. Q1: What has been the impact of Covid-19 on Russia? A1: Compared to elsewhere in Europe and Asia, the impact of Covid-19 in Russia was delayed. While major European countries reported dozens of cases in February, apart from a Chinese national treated in Siberia, no other cases were reported on Russian soil that month, although several Russian nationals contracted the virus abroad. The first Russian national was diagnosed on February 17 by Japanese doctors aboard the Diamond Princess, the British cruise liner that experienced many of the world's early cases. All of these early cases recovered fully, leading to early optimism that Russia would be spared the worst of the crisis. On March 1, President Vladimir Putin declared that the situation in Russia was ``entirely under control.'' Illusions of Russia's invulnerability dissipated over the month of March. The situation has turned very serious over the past few weeks, with the number of confirmed cases exploding from just 495 on March 24 to 10,131 as of April 9. Moscow, as Russia's most-populous city and economic center, accounts for the vast majority of cases. The number of new daily cases is growing exponentially, suggesting the worst of crisis is still to come. After the first death, a 79-year-old pensioner, the death count has risen to 76 as of April 9. The virus could prove especially lethal in Russia, given the country's demographics, which skew heavily toward the elderly. Furthermore, there is a concern that the Russian government is underreporting fatalities, with several elderly victims of the virus having their cause of death officially attributed to other ailments. Going forward, the situation will challenge Russia's society and government. As Putin offers aid to bolster its international image, domestic health services struggle with growing infection rates. The virus has already delayed the constitutional referendum scheduled for April 22 that would have allowed Putin to extend his rule. If the situation continues to deteriorate, Putin and the ruling United Russia Party could suffer a loss in public support; Putin's approval already took a hit in 2019 after the retirement age was raised. Opinion polling suggests that a majority of Russians do not have confidence in the ability of the health care system to cope with the crisis. The virus is also poised to destabilize Russia's economy by causing a dramatic drop in global hydrocarbon demand at a time when oil prices have already been plummeting because of the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. The virus is already disrupting Russian markets, contributing to stock market and ruble volatility. Russia has noteworthy economic safeguards, including significant reserves of hard currency and a strong budget surplus, but its effectiveness in mitigating an economic downturn remains to be seen. Q2: How is the government responding to the outbreak? A2: At the federal level, the response has been varied, but it has been generally late and inconsistent. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin approved the creation of a coronavirus taskforce on January 29. Following nation-specific restrictions, the entry of all foreign nationals was barred on March 18, and a ``high alert status'' was introduced nationwide the following day. On March 31, the State Duma adopted legislation allowing Mishustin to declare a state of emergency during which citizens would face stiff penalties for violating quarantine or knowingly spreading false information. After being largely absent during the early stages of the crisis, Putin has now given two national addresses. On March 27, he declared a week-long nationwide work ``holiday'' (now extended) and introduced measures, such as tax deferments for small- and medium-sized businesses and an increase in maternity capital for eligible families. In a second speech on April 2, Putin extended the national holiday until April 30, representing the most significant federal action taken to date. The speech struck a sterner tone, urging Russians to heed the advice of doctors and the government to follow social distancing guidelines while encouraging regional governments to do more to manage the outbreak locally. The federal government has also recently taken steps to ameliorate the economic consequences of the pandemic, including boosting pay for medical workers, eliminating import duty on ``socially important goods,'' and helping businesses restructure loans. The International Monetary Fund estimates these measures could cost up to 0.3 percent of GDP. In addition, on April 2, Mishustin announced that the cabinet will allocate \$32.9 million from the federal budget to support small- and medium-sized businesses. A further \$63.2 million will be given to credit-providing organizations. The initial lack of clear direction from the Kremlin resulted in a stronger response at the regional and municipal level. So far, around 20 regions have adopted mandatory isolation measures. The first to do so was Chechnya, whose president, Ramzan Kadyrov, ordered ``crowded places'' to be closed on March 24 (adding that people who violated these restrictions should be killed). The Kremlin has since called the closure of regional borders, as Chechnya did, ``excessive.'' Mishustin has also called these measures ``unacceptable.'' The city of Moscow and the surrounding Moscow Oblast have been at the forefront of the local-level response. On February 21, Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced that 2,500 people arriving from China had been placed under quarantine and would be monitored by the city's facial recognition system. Restrictions on mass gatherings were introduced March 11 and extended to Moscow Oblast the following day. Sobyanin urged employers to allow Muscovites to work from home on March 18, and then on March 30, citywide quarantines were imposed in both Moscow and St. Petersburg. This measure, which had been ruled out as late as March 22, was implemented with little warning. The restrictions are quite severe, allowing people to go outside only to ``seek emergency medical care, shop for food or medicine, go to work, walk pets, or take out the garbage.'' Other cities and regions have gone even further. Nizhny Novgorod adopted measures requiring residents to download QR codes that authorities can use to keep tabs on their movement before leaving the house. Sobyanin confirmed Moscow was developing a similar system, but currently has no plans to use it. The measures taken thus far have not come without criticism. After Putin's second speech, opposition politician Aleksey Navalny wrote, ``I will explain Putin's logic. It comes from the fact that almost the entire economy is the state. State employees, employees of state-owned companies and large `controlled' companies will be paid their salaries. The rest - all sorts of designers, lawyers, taxi drivers, waiters, and so on can be sacrificed.'' Civil society groups and activists are also worried about the potential introduction of a state of emergency as well as the use of technology to monitor compliance. Q3: It is still unclear what resources Russia will need to combat the epidemic at home. Why is Russia sending assistance to other countries? A3: While slow to get a handle on the situation inside the country, the Kremlin has delivered medical assistance to some hard-hit countries in a public relations gesture designed to highlight Russia as a reliable partner and public goods provider. So far, Russian assistance has focused on three countries: Italy, Serbia, and the United States. Russian military medical equipment first arrived in Italy on March 22 following a conversation between Putin and Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte. In addition to medical supplies, over 100 Russian military personnel trained in biological, chemical, and nuclear decontamination are now present in the country for a campaign named ``From Russia With Love.'' The assistance comes as the Italian government has expressed frustration with the European Union and other European countries for their delayed, uncoordinated response to a crisis that has left thousands of Italians dead. As Italy's commissioner for the coronavirus emergency pointed out, ``France has given us 2 million masks, Germany has sent us a few dozen ventilators \ldots{} planes from Russia . . . brought 180 doctors, nurses, ventilators, and masks.'' Russia has also sent military medics and medical equipment to Serbia. This assistance included 11 flights and 87 military medics. Russian state media has reported that personnel have now disinfected arenas, provided consultations, trained Serbian personnel, and ``analyzed the epidemiological situation.'' More striking was Russia's delivery of medical assistance to the United States. A Russian Air Force cargo plane landed in New York on April 1 carrying protective gear and ventilators. The nature of this delivery was described differently by the two countries: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declared that "Trump accepted this humanitarian aid with gratitude," but the State Department emphasized that the supplies were purchased. Either way, Russian assistance stands out amid the mutual recrimination that has characterized U.S.-Russia relations for the last several years. It also allows Moscow to call attention to Washington's inadequate response to the pandemic and to reverse the longstanding portrayal of Russia as dependent on the West. Russian aid has not come without criticism both about its effectiveness and about Moscow's ulterior motives. The Italian newspaper La Stampa reported that 80 percent of what Russia provided to Italy is useless. Some observers have also questioned whether the presence of Russian military personnel in a NATO country could be used for intelligence purposes. Similar assessments on the quality of equipment provided to the United States have not yet been reported in the press; however, critics have been quick to charge that the aid is designed to sway U.S. opinion, including around sanctions, and is more about public relations than public health. Q4: How does Russia use Covid-19 in its disinformation campaigns? A4: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently identified Russia, Iran, and China as the prime culprits in spreading disinformation related to Covid-19. Russia's objectives are twofold: (1) like China, Russia is concerned with protecting its image, having mismanaged the early crisis; and (2) Russia seeks to confuse international opinion and call into question the West's response\textemdash even as it seizes the opportunity to garner good will by providing humanitarian assistance (including to the United States). Russian virus-related disinformation targets both foreign and domestic audiences. A multitude of narratives are rapidly generated and disseminated in a manner reminiscent of what a report from the RAND Corporation calls a ``firehose of falsehoods,'' i.e., a stream of misleading claims so large and constant that it overwhelms efforts at debunking. Specific stories may even contradict each other. For example, Russia's disinformation campaign has simultaneously alleged that the virus is a hoax and that it is man-made. Reminiscent of disinformation campaigns from the Cold War, one prominent narrative alleges that the virus is a U.S.-made biological weapon. Several stories pushed by Russian media have pointed to the Tbilisi Lugar Lab, a U.S.-funded lab in the country of Georgia that tests infectious diseases and monitors pathogens, as the alleged source of the virus. Another story claims a broader conspiracy between the United Kingdom and the United States, describing the virus as an ``Anglo-Saxon biological warning.'' This tactic is a modern-day revival of the biological disinformation campaigns conducted by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the most notable of which accused the United States of developing AIDS. In Operation Denver, this fake story was initially spread by the KGB on fringe publications but was eventually picked up by mainstream publications and achieved mass reach. Its impact is still felt today, with some segments of the U.S. population believing the lie. While the impact of Russian disinformation operations related to Covid-19 will not be known for some time, early indicators and past lessons suggest that virus-related disinformation can be particularly effective. As Operation Denver showed, the fear and uncertainty surrounding a pandemic makes societies especially vulnerable to the circulation and adoption of false beliefs. Research has shown how anxiety facilitates information seeking, which can leave individuals and societies more susceptible to believing disinformation and half-truths. In the United Kingdom, for example, several cell towers were burned in connection with a conspiracy about Covid-19 and 5G. Russian involvement is suspected, given past efforts at stoking fears about 5G technology. Russian disinformation may endanger Russia itself. The very half-truths and conspiracies that Russia peddles risk being internalized by its own citizens. Russia expert Mark Galeotti notes that Russia's own disinformation threatens ``the serious and sober efforts to educate the population about the threat and to ensure buy-in for the public health campaigns at work.'' In Moscow's calculus, however, the rewards likely outweigh the risks. As the crisis develops, expect Russia to continue to take advantage of the situation, tailoring its disinformation to play to societal anxieties and institutional vulnerabilities abroad in an effort to undermine trust in governments it views as hostile.

  abstract = {Granger causality methods were developed to analyze the flow of information between time series. These methods have become more widely applied in neuroscience. Frequency-domain causality measures, such as those of Geweke, as well as multivariate methods, have particular appeal in neuroscience due to the prevalence of oscillatory phenomena and highly multivariate experimental recordings. Despite its widespread application in many fields, there are ongoing concerns regarding the applicability of Granger causality methods in neuroscience. When are these methods appropriate? How reliably do they recover the system structure underlying the observed data? What do frequency-domain causality measures tell us about the functional properties of oscillatory neural systems? In this paper, we analyze fundamental properties of Granger\textendash Geweke (GG) causality, both computational and conceptual. Specifically, we show that (               i               ) GG causality estimates can be either severely biased or of high variance, both leading to spurious results; (               ii               ) even if estimated correctly, GG causality estimates alone are not interpretable without examining the component behaviors of the system model; and (               iii               ) GG causality ignores critical components of a system's dynamics. Based on this analysis, we find that the notion of causality quantified is incompatible with the objectives of many neuroscience investigations, leading to highly counterintuitive and potentially misleading results. Through the analysis of these problems, we provide important conceptual clarification of GG causality, with implications for other related causality approaches and for the role of causality analyses in neuroscience as a whole.},

Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policies to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens.

  abstract = {The novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in mainland China has rapidly spread across the globe. Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95\% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95\% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5\% (95\% CI: 68.8 to 72.0\%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3\% (95\% CI: 80.5 to 82.1\%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.},

Existing predictions are merely based on qualitative analyses and mathematical modeling. The use of available big data with machine learning is still limited in COVID-19 growth prediction even though the availability of data is abundance. To make use of big data in the prediction using deep learning, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to learn the correlation of COVID-19 growth over time. The structure of an LSTM layer is searched heuristically until the best validation score is achieved. First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the globe. We achieved favorable performance compared with that of the recurrent neural network (RNN) method with a comparable low validation error. The evaluation is conducted based on graph visualization and root mean squared error (RMSE). We found that it is not easy to achieve the same quantity of confirmed cases over time. However, LSTM provide a similar pattern between the actual cases and prediction. In the future, our proposed prediction can be used for anticipating forthcoming pandemics.

This study has been investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the number of people involved in crashes accounting for the intensity of different control measures using Negative Binomial (NB) method. Based on a comprehensive dataset of people involved in crashes aggregated in New York City during January 1, 2020 to May 24, 2020, people involved in crashes with respect to travel behavior, traffic characteristics and socio-demographic characteristics are found. The results show that the average person miles traveled on the main traffic mode per person per day, percentage of work trip have positive effect on person involved in crashes. On the contrary, unemployment rate and inflation rate have negative effects on person involved in crashes. Interestingly, different level of control policies during COVID-19 outbreak are closely associated with safety awareness, driving and travel behavior, and thus has an indirect influence on the frequency of crashes. Comparing to other three control policies including emergence declare, limits on mass gatherings, and ban on all nonessential gathering, the negative relationship between stay-at-home policy implemented in New York City from March 20, 2020 and the number of people involved crashes is found in our study.},
