<p>This folder summarizes the confirmed cases from <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/">WHO COVID-2019 situation reports</a>. WHO defines the confirmed case as “a person with laboratory confirmation of 2019-nCoV
infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. “ (<a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)">Source</a>) Therefore, its data on and after Feb 13 should have a huge gap compared with our <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports">daily reports</a>. In order to bring a more comprehensive picture of the current coronavirus situation, we create this folder, which will serve as a good complementary to our daily report and the dashboard.</p>
