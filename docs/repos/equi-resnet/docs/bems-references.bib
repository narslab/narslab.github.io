  abstract = {Energy is the lifeblood of modern societies. In the past decades, the world's energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions increased rapidly due to the increases in population and comfort demands of people. Building energy consumption prediction is essential for energy planning, management, and conservation. Data-driven models provide a practical approach to energy consumption prediction. This paper offers a review of the studies that developed data-driven building energy consumption prediction models, with a particular focus on reviewing the scopes of prediction, the data properties and the data preprocessing methods used, the machine learning algorithms utilized for prediction, and the performance measures used for evaluation. Based on this review, existing research gaps are identified and future research directions in the area of data-driven building energy consumption prediction are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Scenarios provide a commonly used and intuitively appealing means to communicate and characterize uncertainty in many decision support applications, but can fall short of their potential especially when used in broad public debates among participants with diverse interests and values. This paper describes a new approach to participatory, computer-assisted scenario development that we call scenario discovery, which aims to address these challenges. The approach defines scenarios as a set of plausible future states of the world that represent vulnerabilities of proposed policies, that is, cases where a policy fails to meet its performance goals. Scenario discovery characterizes such sets by helping users to apply statistical or data-mining algorithms to databases of simulation-model-generated results in order to identify easy-to-interpret combinations of uncertain model input parameters that are highly predictive of these policy-relevant cases. The approach has already proved successful in several high impact policy studies. This paper systematically describes the scenario discovery concept and its implementation, presents statistical tests to evaluate the resulting scenarios, and demonstrates the approach on an example policy problem involving the efficacy of a proposed U.S. renewable energy standard. The paper also describes how scenario discovery appears to address several outstanding challenges faced when applying traditional scenario approaches in contentious public debates.},

Specifically, one seeks a set of subregions of the input variable space within which the value of the output variable is considerably larger (or smaller) than its average value over the entire input domain. In addition it is usually desired that these regions be describable in an interpretable form involving simple statements (``rules'') concerning the input values. This paper presents a procedure directed towards this goal based on the notion of ``patient'' rule induction. This patient strategy is contrasted with the greedy ones used by most rule induction methods, and semi-greedy ones used by some partitioning tree techniques such as CART.

Using data on 93 million individual households, we estimate these GHGs across the contiguous United States and clarify the respective influence of climate, affluence, energy infrastructure, urban form, and building attributes (age, housing type, heating fuel) in driving these emissions. A ranking by state reveals that GHGs (per unit floor space) are lowest in Western US states and highest in Central states. Wealthier Americans have per capita footprints {$\sim$}25\% higher than those of lower-income residents, primarily due to larger homes. In especially affluent suburbs, these emissions can be 15 times higher than nearby neighborhoods. If the electrical grid is decarbonized, then the residential housing sector can meet the 28\% emission reduction target for 2025 under the Paris Agreement. However, grid decarbonization will be insufficient to meet the 80\% emissions reduction target for 2050 due to a growing housing stock and continued use of fossil fuels (natural gas, propane, and fuel oil) in homes. Meeting this target will also require deep energy retrofits and transitioning to distributed low-carbon energy sources, as well as reducing per capita floor space and zoning denser settlement patterns.},

  abstract = {This study introduces a new open source software framework to support bottom-up environmental systems planning under deep uncertainty with a focus on many-objective robust decision making (MORDM), called OpenMORDM. OpenMORDM contains two complementary components: (1) a software application programming interface (API) for connecting planning models to computational exploration tools for many-objective optimization and sensitivity-based discovery of critical deeply uncertain factors; and (2) a web-based visualization toolkit for exploring high-dimensional datasets to better understand system trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. We demonstrate the OpenMORDM framework on a challenging environmental management test case termed the ``lake problem''. The lake problem has been used extensively in the prior environmental decision science literature and, in this study, captures the challenges posed by conflicting economic and environmental objectives, a water quality ``tipping point'' beyond which the lake may become irreversibly polluted, and multiple deeply uncertain factors that may undermine the robustness of pollution management policies. The OpenMORDM software framework enables decision makers to identify policy-relevant scenarios, quantify the trade-offs between alternative strategies in different scenarios, flexibly explore alternative definitions of robustness, and identify key system factors that should be monitored as triggers for future actions or additional planning. The web-based OpenMORDM visualization toolkit allows decision makers to easily share and visualize their datasets, with the option for analysts to extend the framework with customized scripts in the R programming language. OpenMORDM provides a platform for constructive decision support, allowing analysts and decision makers to interactively discover promising alternatives and potential vulnerabilities while balancing conflicting objectives.},

  abstract = {Developing robust policies for complex systems is a profound challenge because of their nonlinear and unpredictable nature. Dealing with these characteristics requires innovative approaches. A possible approach is to design policies that can be adapted over time in response to how the future unfolds. An essential part of adaptive policymaking is specifying under what conditions, and in which way, to adapt the policy. The performance of an adaptive policy is critically dependent on this: if the policy is adapted too late or too early, significant deterioration in policy performance can be incurred. An additional complicating factor is that in almost any policy problem, a multiplicity of divergent and potentially conflicting objectives has to be considered. In this paper we tackle both problems simultaneously through the use of multi-objective robust simulation optimization. Robust optimization helps in specifying appropriate conditions for adapting a policy, by identifying conditions that produce satisfactory results across a large ensemble of scenarios. Multi-objective optimization helps in identifying such conditions for a set of criteria, and providing insights into the tradeoffs between these criteria. Simulation is used for evaluating policy performance. This approach results in the identification of multiple alternative conditions under which to adapt a policy, rather than a single set of conditions. This creates the possibility of an informed policy debate on trade-offs. The approach is illustrated through a case study on designing a robust policy for supporting the transition toward renewable energy systems in the European Union. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be efficiently used for developing policy suggestions and for improving decision support for policymakers. By extension, it is possible to apply this methodology in dynamically complex and deeply uncertain systems such as public health, financial systems, transportation, and housing.},

One of the main challenges of scenario approaches is that analysts have to try and capture the full breadth of uncertainty about the future in a small set of scenarios. In the presence of deep uncertainty, this is even more challenging. Scenario discovery is a model-based technique inspired by the scenario logic school that addresses this challenge. In scenario discovery, an ensemble of model runs is created that encompasses the various uncertainties perceived by the actors involved in particular decision making situations. The ensemble is subsequently screened to identify runs of interest, and their conditions for occurring are identified through machine learning. Here, we extend scenario discovery to cope with dynamics over time. To this end, a time series clustering approach is applied to the ensemble of model runs in order to identify different types of dynamics. The types of dynamics are subsequently analyzed to identify dynamics that are of interest, and their causes for occurrence are revealed. This dynamic scenario discovery approach is illustrated with a case about copper scarcity.},

To deal with these uncertainties, dynamic adaptive policies that can be changed over time are suggested. This paper presents a model-driven approach supporting the development of promising adaptation pathways, and illustrates the approach using a hypothetical case. We use robust optimization over uncertainties related to climate change, land use, cause-effect relations, and policy efficacy, to identify the most promising pathways. For this purpose, we generate an ensemble of possible futures and evaluate candidate pathways over this ensemble using an Integrated Assessment Meta Model. We understand `most promising' in terms of the robustness of the performance of the candidate pathways on multiple objectives, and use a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find the set of most promising pathways. This results in an adaptation map showing the set of most promising adaptation pathways and options for transferring from one pathway to another. Given the pathways and signposts, decision-makers can make an informed decision on a dynamic adaptive plan in a changing environment that is able to achieve their intended objectives despite the myriad of uncertainties.},

The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM). This algorithm identifies regions in an uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, PRIM uses a hill-climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that PRIM can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and valleys. In case of PRIM, these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of PRIM. This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple PRIM analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated using three cases. Each of the cases has been published before and used PRIM. We compare the results found using PRIM with the results found using the improved version of PRIM. We find that the improved version is more robust to new data, can better cope with heterogeneously typed data, and is less prone to overfitting.},

Existing techniques for scenario discovery, however, focus only on finding a subspace that minimizes the number of nondecision relevant model runs. Adopting a single objective optimization approach for a many-objective optimization problem implies that the full trade-off space is not identified. In this paper, we introduce a many-objective optimization approach for scenario discovery. We compare this with an improved usage of Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) for identifying the multidimensional trade-offs amongst coverage, density, and interpretability. We find that the many-objective optimization approach produces results which slightly dominate those of the improved version of PRIM on all three objectives. Qualitatively, however, both approaches identify essentially the same subspaces. The prime benefits of the many-objective optimization approach are its potential in bringing additional scenario relevant concerns such as consistency or diversity into the scenario discovery framework, as well as its ability to avoid overfitting. Potentially more important, it also paves the way for future work on using more sophisticated metaheuristic optimization approaches for scenario discovery.},

However, no systematic, general approach exists for finding robust strategies using the broad range of models and data often available to decision makers. This study demonstrates robust decision making (RDM), an analytic method that helps design robust strategies through an iterative process that first suggests candidate robust strategies, identifies clusters of future states of the world to which they are vulnerable, and then evaluates the trade-offs in hedging against these vulnerabilities. This approach can help decision makers design robust strategies while also systematically generating clusters of key futures interpretable as narrative scenarios. Our study demonstrates the approach by identifying robust, adaptive, near-term pollution-control strategies to help ensure economic growth and environmental quality throughout the 21st century.},

Robust Decision Making (RDM) is a set of concepts, processes, and enabling tools that use computation, not to make better predictions, but to yield better decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty. RDM combines Decision Analysis, Assumption-Based Planning, scenarios, and Exploratory Modeling to stress test strategies over myriad plausible paths into the future, and then to identify policy-relevant scenarios and robust adaptive strategies. RDM embeds analytic tools in a decision support process called ``deliberation with analysis'' that promotes learning and consensus-building among stakeholders.

The example also highlights RDM's approach to adaptive strategies, agent-based modeling, and complex systems. Frontiers for RDM development include expanding the capabilities of multi-objective RDM (MORDM), more extensive evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of RDM-based decision support systems, and using RDM's ability to reflect multiple world views and ethical frameworks to help improve the way organizations use and communicate analytics for wicked problems.},

However, as a result of randomness and noisy disturbance, it is not an easy task to realize accurate prediction of the building energy consumption. In order to obtain better building energy consumption prediction accuracy, an extreme deep learning approach is presented in this paper. The proposed approach combines stacked autoencoders (SAEs) with the extreme learning machine (ELM) to take advantage of their respective characteristics. In this proposed approach, the SAE is used to extract the building energy consumption features, while the ELM is utilized as a predictor to obtain accurate prediction results. To determine the input variables of the extreme deep learning model, the partial autocorrelation analysis method is adopted. Additionally, in order to examine the performances of the proposed approach, it is compared with some popular machine learning methods, such as the backward propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), the generalized radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has the best prediction performance in different cases of the building energy consumption.},

The most important reason is that the predictive structure with best performance is difficult to be determined. To fill the gap, this paper offers one in-depth review, which focuses on the accuracy analyses and model comparisons. Specifically, the accuracy analyses were conducted based on different types of buildings (e.g. residential building, commercial building, government building or educational building), different type of temporal granularity (e.g. sub-hourly, hourly, daily or annual), as well as input/output variables and historical data collections. Further, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), as the epidemic models, were compared in terms of their complexity of prediction processes, accuracies of results, the amounts of required historical data, the numbers of inputs, etc. Then the hybrid and single machine learning methods were outlined and compared in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, several vital defects and further research directions are presented from a multivariate perspective. We hope that machine learning method could capture more attention from investigators via our introduction and perspective, due to its potential development of accuracy and reliability.},

The performance of SVM with respect to two parameters, c and g, is explored using the k-fold cross validation with grid searching method based on radial-basis function kernel. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is checked by comparing the prediction model with statistic data taken from Chinese National Bureau of Statistics in 30 provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities) of China using statistical error tests such as the mean square error (MSE) and the squared correlation coefficient (r2).

Focusing on South America, we translate an ensemble of long-term electricity supply scenarios into policy insights and use post-processing methods to present a systematic mapping of solution outputs to model inputs. We find demand levels, the cost of capital and the level of CO2-limits to be significant determinants of total investment cost. Low-carbon pathways are associated with low demand and low cost of capital. When cost of capital increases a shift away from wind and hydropower to natural gas and solar PV is seen.

RDM was intended for use with formal models. However, we show a model-less RDM application to a portfolio planning problem (selecting U.S. Army security cooperation activities with a partner country) seeking to achieve several objectives. In the absence of formal models, the analysis tests candidate actions against different explicit statements of causal relationships to allow more systematic reasoning over choices and outcomes. Doing so renders assumptions about complex systems explicit, characterizes uncertainties in terms of effect on weighting policy choices rather than as presently unknowable probabilities, provides a venue for planners and evaluators to share findings and insights, and yields explicit expressions of theories of causation (TOC) that themselves act as formal models where none had previously existed. RDM allows important scenarios for decision planning to be generated analytically. This may address for several scenario applications the question of determining important futures and also how scenario results may be used directly to inform policy and operational decisions.},

Given that energy consumption in buildings is influenced by aspects of urban form such as density and floor-area-ratios (FAR), understanding the distribution of energy intensities is critical for city planners. This paper presents a novel technique for estimating commercial building energy consumption from a small number of building features by training machine learning models on national data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). Our results show that gradient boosting regression models perform the best at predicting commercial building energy consumption, and can make predictions that are on average within a factor of 2 from the true energy consumption values (with an r2 score of 0.82). We validate our models using the New York City Local Law 84 energy consumption dataset, then apply them to the city of Atlanta to create aggregate energy consumption estimates. In general, the models developed only depend on five commonly accessible building and climate features, and can therefore be applied to diverse metropolitan areas in the United States and to other countries through replication of our methodology.},

Therefore, improvement of energy efficiency of the building sector has become an essential target to reduce the amount of gas emission as well as fossil fuel consumption. One most effective approach to reducing CO2 emission and energy consumption with regards to new buildings is to consider energy efficiency at a very early design stage. On the other hand,efficient energy management and smart refurbishments can enhance energy performance of the existing stock. All these solutions entail accurate energy prediction for optimal decision making. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) in general and machine learning (ML) techniques in specific terms have been proposed for forecasting of building energy consumption and performance.

  abstract = {There is increasing concern over deep uncertainty in the risk analysis field as probabilistic models of uncertainty cannot always be confidently determined or agreed upon for many of our most pressing contemporary risk challenges. This is particularly true in the climate change adaptation field, and has prompted the development of a number of frameworks aiming to characterize system vulnerabilities and identify robust alternatives. One such methodology is robust decision making (RDM), which uses simulation models to assess how strategies perform over many plausible conditions and then identifies and characterizes those where the strategy fails in a process termed scenario discovery. While many of the problems to which RDM has been applied are characterized by multiple objectives, research to date has provided little insight into how treatment of multiple criteria impacts the failure scenarios identified. In this research, we compare different methods for incorporating multiple objectives into the scenario discovery process to evaluate how they impact the resulting failure scenarios. We use the Lake Tana basin in Ethiopia as a case study, where climatic and environmental uncertainties could impact multiple planned water infrastructure projects, and find that failure scenarios may vary depending on the method used to aggregate multiple criteria. Common methods used to convert multiple attributes into a single utility score can obscure connections between failure scenarios and system performance, limiting the information provided to support decision making. Applying scenario discovery over each performance metric separately provides more nuanced information regarding the relative sensitivity of the objectives to different uncertain parameters, leading to clearer insights on measures that could be taken to improve system robustness and areas where additional research might prove useful.},

Previous studies, especially recent explorations in the emerging field of urban building energy modelling (UBEM), suggest clear neighbourhood-scale energy impact from building type, density, layout/orientation and facade/fenestration treatment. The purpose of research is to inform design, but how the research findings in urban building energy inform urban design practice is not straight-forward, in that real-world urban development involves all stakeholders and needs to take environmental, social and economical factors into account, in addition to energy and urban climate. If to support more healthy, comfortable and energy-efficient urban district/neighbourhood is one goal of green neighbourhood development (ND) rating tools, we should investigate possibilities to further and more efficiently integrate findings of UBEM into guidelines and credits system that inform climate-responsive urban design. This paper, based on a review on recent advancement in UBEM, investigates a more comprehensive and systematic prescriptive approach in ND to optimizing urban building energy performance by moderating urban form, fabric and land cover. Although UBEM as a scientific tool is diagnostic in evaluating urban design scenarios on a case basis, prescriptive design guidelines based on good science are suitable and useful for architects in integrating urban building energy issues in practice.},

This paper demonstrates a comparative study of four data-driven methods used in online building energy predictions involving large-scale data extracted from several types of buildings. The characteristics of building electricity use and data reliability were addressed through the data pre-treatment process including visualization, cleaning, parsing and filtering. Mathematical algorithms and their applications in previous studies were summarized and compared, and evaluation methods were developed. The performance and suitable application scenarios of the proposed algorithms were conducted via the comparison of monitoring data and predicted results. The study indicates that the most complex method which requires the highest computation ability, i.e., the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), does not lead to the highest accuracy, while as the fastest computation method, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) usually has the results with the lowest accuracy. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) methods usually perform better in the case scenarios studied. All the prediction accuracies can meet the requirements of RMSE {$<$}30\% and NMBE {$<$}10\% proposed by ASHRAE, and the computation time varies from less than 1~s to 22~s per prediction. All these methods/algorithms worked well for buildings with stable energy use patterns. For buildings with complex and unstable occupancy schedules and energy use patterns, MLR and SVM methods have the ability to achieve a high accuracy with fast computation speed.},
