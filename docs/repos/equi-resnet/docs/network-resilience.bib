  abstract = {A simulation-based model used to measure resilience indicators of the railway transportation system is presented. This model is tested through a perturbation scenario: the inoperability of a track which links two stations in the system. The performance of the system is modelled through two indicators: (a) the number of passengers that reach their destination and (b) the total delay of passengers after a serious perturbation. The number of passengers within a given station at a given time is considered as early warning in the model. Furthermore, a crisis management plan has been simulated for this perturbation scenario in order to help the system to recover quickly from this perturbation. This crisis management plan emphasizes the role and the importance of the proposed indicators when managing crises.},

Most studies in urban mobility and planning often ignore the multi-layer nature of transportation systems considering only aggregated versions of this complex scenario. In this work we present a model for the representation of the transportation system of an entire city as a multiplex network. Using two different perspectives, one in which each line is a layer and one in which lines of the same transportation mode are grouped together, we study the interconnected structure of 9 different cities in Europe raging from small towns to mega-cities like London and Berlin highlighting their vulnerabilities and possible improvements. Finally, for the city of Zaragoza in Spain, we also consider data about service schedule and waiting times, which allow us to create a simple yet realistic model for urban mobility able to reproduce real-world facts and to test for network improvements.},

  abstract = {Transportation systems such as rail, road, and waterways are key component of critical infrastructure systems, providing connectivity between other components to enable the production and distribution of goods and services. During large scale disasters such as earth quakes and floods, this connectivity is disrupted, restricting or completely halting the flow of goods and services. To ensure that the connectivity between the different modes of transportation are restored in an aftermath of these disruptions, the interdependence between them and the importance of individual elements to the overall connectivity have to be studied and formulated to develop a system-level restoration plan. This paper presents a framework to develop efficient restoration schemes for a road transportation network in an aftermath of a disruption. The road transportation network is modelled using graph theory analytics. Using a system oriented parameter such as the Eigen-vector centrality measure associated with the road transportation, it is possible to understand the importance of different network components. This model captures the interdependence between the different elements in the road transportation network critical in understanding failure effects by identifying the important nodes in the network using the Eigen-vector centrality measure. The model is constructed from publically available data for Saint-Louis, Missouri. By performing a sensitivity analysis, we have found that the node with the highest Eigen-vector centrality measures are shown to provide a higher value within a ninety-five percent confidence level, indicating low sensitivity to changes in input parameters. This provides a measure to determine the most important nodes to place back into service to assist in restoring an urban center’s supply chain in the wake of an extreme event.},

  abstract = {Rural transportation networks are highly susceptible to geohazards such as earthquakes and landslides. Indirect losses can be severe because the breakdown of a transportation network aggravates rescue, supply, and other recovery activities. The operations and logistics of rural networks that are under seismic risks must be managed using the limited resources specifically in developing countries. We propose a methodology to evaluate road recovery strategies for restoring connectivity after blockages due to earthquakes and earthquake-triggered landslides. This paper gives insight into the recovery process, which can be used by decision-makers for enhancing resilience and supplying immediate relief to rural areas. The proposed framework has four steps: 1) identification of strategies for increasing recovery performance, 2) determination of graph-based metrics to represent network connectivity, 3) applying topology-based and Monte Carlo simulations to each strategy, and 4) analysis of recovery times to compare these resilience-enhancement strategies. The methodology was tested using a case study from Sindhupalchok District, Nepal, a region that was severely affected by the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. The closed road segments and recovery times were determined through field surveys with locals and governmental authorities, and by investigating the intensity of earthquake-triggered landslides. Our results showed that the proposed approach provides information about the recovery behavior of road networks and simplifies the evaluation process. It is robust enough to extend and assess decision-makers’ preferences for improving resilience.},

However, not all road links equally affect the travel conditions in a given network; typically some links are more critical to the network functioning than the others. It is noted that the majority of the existing indices designed to measure vulnerability offer a good measure of network-wide accessibility in sparse regional networks, but they rarely consider the extent of serviceability of critical links in dense urban road networks. This paper describes a number of vulnerability indices from the literature, applies them to the case of urban network of York and discusses the results. It proposes a new vulnerability index considering the serviceability of road links and illustrates its computation. Finally, this paper uses the results of the new vulnerability index and outlines a traffic diversion plan in the event of flooding in York using traffic network modelling techniques combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application.},

The paper briefly reviews the work already carried out on economic vulnerability and extends the research towards the development of a conceptual and methodological framework for the definition and measurement of economic resilience. Towards this end, the paper proposes an index of economic resilience gauging the adequacy of policy in four broad areas, namely macroeconomic stability, microeconomic market efficiency, good governance and social development. The analysis of economic resilience explains how small economies can attain a relatively high level of gross domestic product per capita if they adopt appropriate policy stances. In other words, the relatively good economic performance of a number of small states is not because, but in spite of, their small size and inherent economic vulnerability. The results of this study can be used as a tool towards the formulation of policies aimed at overcoming the adverse consequences of economic vulnerability.},

The results have been obtained on two public transportation networks: the bus network in Florence, Italy, and the transportation network in the Attika region, Greece. The analysis implements a topological approach, based on graph theory, using a multi-graph to model public transportation networks and analyse vulnerabilities with respect to the removal of one or more of their components. Both directed attacks and cascading failures are considered. While the first type of disruptive events is related to a static analysis, where nodes are removed according to a rank related to some centrality measures, the second type is related to a dynamic analysis, where a failure cascade is simulated making unavailable the node with the highest betweenness value. Vulnerability measures are computed as loss of connectivity and efficiency, with respect to both the two different types of disruptive events considered. This study allows to evidence potential vulnerabilities of the urban networks, that must be considered to support the planning process into the creation of resilient structures.},

  abstract = {One of the most important tasks of urban and hazard planning is to mitigate the damages and minimize the costs of the recovery process after catastrophic events. In this context, the capability of urban systems and communities to recover from disasters is referred to as resilience. Despite the problem of resilience quantification having received a lot of attention, a mathematical definition of the resilience of an urban community, which takes into account the social aspects of an urban environment, has not yet been identified. In this article, we provide and test a methodology for the assessment of urban resilience to catastrophic events which aims at bridging the gap between the engineering and the ecosystem approaches to resilience. We propose to model an urban system by means of different hybrid social–physical complex networks, obtained by enriching the urban street network with additional information about the social and physical constituents of a city, namely citizens, residential buildings, and services. Then, we introduce a class of efficiency measures on these hybrid networks, inspired by the definition of global efficiency given in complex network theory, and we show that these measures can be effectively used to quantify the resilience of an urban system, by comparing their respective values before and after a catastrophic event and during the reconstruction process. As a case study, we consider simulated earthquakes in the city of Acerra, Italy, and we use these efficiency measures to compare the ability of different reconstruction strategies in restoring the original performance of the urban system.},

  abstract = {Major disruptions of transportation systems due to severe weather events such as hurricanes, storm surges, and flooding are becoming more common. A logical response is to make those systems better able to withstand and rebound from large-scale weather assaults. Resilience is the term commonly used to describe this property of transportation systems, and while there are numerous definitions of resilience, there is no commonly used metric to characterize it. This paper reviews the concept of resilience in different fields and offers a definition that encompasses three common strategies for making transportation systems more resilient: hardening, redundancy, and elasticity. The paper offers a graphical and analytic metric for assessing the resilience of scheduled transportation services in the face of weather disruptions, focusing on heavy rail transit (HRT) systems. The concept of planned service days lost to weather disruptions is suggested as a useful aggregate measure of system resilience that is normalized for system scale. The measure is applied to data from the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority rail transit system to illustrate the effects of Hurricanes Irene and Sandy, as well as a major snowstorm that hit New York City, and to suggest the ways in which the proposed measures can be used for ex post evaluation of response to weather events, as well as to support system management decisions. A comparative application of the measure for New York HRT and New Jersey Transit (NJT) commuter rail illustrates the use of this normalized measure across two different transit services.},

Decision trees, random forest, the AdaBoost and the k-Nearest-Neighbors were implemented to build models which can predict delays of individual flights. Then, each of the algorithms' prediction accuracy and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were compared.

The metrics range from those specific to the number of trips to more holistic measures that include the contribution of these trips directly and indirectly to economic activity. These metrics can aid decision-makers in rendering more informed judgments about resource allocation and how to design a portfolio of security and recovery strategies. The paper also provides a framework for evaluating transportation risk, including the important role of perceptions in potentially amplifying these risks. It provides a range of strategies to promote resilience as well. Resilience of a transportation system is then quantified using the real-world case of the 2005 London subway and bus bombings. In terms of ordinary resilience, we find that 77.4 percent of total journey reductions on attacked modes were offset by increases in substitute modes for the 4 months following the attacks. We also estimate that 76.9 percent of total journey reductions on attacked modes were the result of a “fear factor,” as opposed to capacity reductions. The paper concludes with a set of proposed prospective resilience measures to evaluate the potential resilience of a transportation system. These metrics are based on the vulnerability, flexibility, and resource availability to cope with a terrorist attack or natural disaster.},

Therefore, policymakers are working relentlessly to ensure the uninterrupted functionality of the transport network. Recently, the focus of transport infrastructure management has shifted from protection to resilience. The concept of resilience is intended to capture a system’s ability to maintain its function and rapidity to return to a normal state after a major disruption. This article introduces a novel approach for measuring the resiliency of the transportation network incorporating the travel pattern. This approach allows decision makers to assess the effectiveness of recovery strategies by comparing with the proposed resilience index. Here, the analogy of energy transmission is utilized to describe the concept of resilience. The approach is demonstrated for Dhaka, Bangladesh based on a simulated disaster. The case study focuses on the potential disruptions of some links of the network. We investigate the changes in the shortest route after the disruption of the transport network. The results indicate that a decision maker first rebuilds a connected network and then focuses on improving the functionality.},

Two particular concepts seem to be particularly relevant: scale-free patterns and small-worlds. By looking at 33 metro systems in the world, this paper adapts network science methodologies to the transportation literature, and offers one application to the robustness of metros; here, metro refers to urban rail transit with exclusive right-of-way, whether it is underground, at grade or elevated. We find that most metros are indeed scale-free (with scaling factors ranging from 2.10 to 5.52) and small-worlds; they show atypical behaviors, however, with increasing size. In particular, the presence of transfer-hubs (stations hosting more than three lines) results in relatively large scaling factors. The analysis provides insights/recommendations for increasing the robustness of metro networks. Smaller networks should focus on creating transfer stations, thus generating cycles to offer alternative routes. For larger networks, few stations seem to detain a certain monopole on transferring, it is therefore important to create additional transfers, possibly at the periphery of city centers; the Tokyo system seems to remarkably incorporate these properties.},

Design/methodology/approach The data from the project are drawn from eight barangays in Tacloban City, the Philippines. Local residents and politicians were surveyed and interviewed to examine perceptions of resilience and community self-help. Findings The evidence shows that haphazard or inequitable distribution of relief goods and services generated discontent within communities. However, whilst perceptions of community cooperation and self-help are relatively low, perceptions of resilience are relatively high. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted in urban communities after a sudden large-scale disaster. The findings are not necessarily applicable in the rural context or in relation to slow onset disasters. Practical implications Relief agencies should think more carefully about the social impact of the distribution of relief goods and services. Inequality can undermine community level cooperation. Social implications A better consideration of social as well as material capital in the aftermath of disaster could help community self-help, resilience and positive adaptation. Originality/value This study draws on evidence from local communities to contradict the overarching rhetoric of resilience in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda.},

We have seen that while resilience is a useful concept, its diversity in usage complicates its interpretation and measurement. In this paper, we have proposed a resilience analysis framework and a metric for measuring resilience. Our analysis framework consists of system identification, resilience objective setting, vulnerability analysis, and stakeholder engagement. The implementation of this framework is focused on the achievement of three resilience capacities: adaptive capacity, absorptive capacity, and recoverability. These three capacities also form the basis of our proposed resilience factor and uncertainty-weighted resilience metric. We have also identified two important unresolved discussions emerging in the literature: the idea of resilience as an epistemological versus inherent property of the system, and design for ecological versus engineered resilience in socio-technical systems. While we have not resolved this tension, we have shown that our framework and metric promote the development of methodologies for investigating “deep” uncertainties in resilience assessment while retaining the use of probability for expressing uncertainties about highly uncertain, unforeseeable, or unknowable hazards in design and management activities.},

  abstract = {Urban transportation systems are vulnerable to congestion, accidents, weather, special events, and other costly delays. Whereas typical policy responses prioritize reduction of delays under normal conditions to improve the efficiency of urban road systems, analytic support for investments that improve resilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still scarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by mapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to links. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays using link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality measures, estimating the number of individuals using corresponding road segments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period auto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data, with the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the change in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary between cities, with increased delays due to a 5\% random loss of road linkages ranging from 9.5\% in Los Angeles to 56.0\% in San Francisco. The results demonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under normal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more efficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just efficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and justify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions. Comparing traffic delays finds that some cities with efficient road networks are less resilient than inefficient cities. Comparing traffic delays finds that some cities with efficient road networks are less resilient than inefficient cities.},

  abstract = {Establishing consistent criteria for assessing the performance of structural systems and infrastructure networks is a critical component of communities’ efforts to optimize investment decisions for the upkeep and renewal of the built environment. Although member-level performance and reliability assessment procedures are currently well-established, it is widely recognized that a member-oriented approach does not necessarily lead to an efficient utilization of limited resources when making decisions related to the management of existing deteriorating structures or lifeline systems, especially those that may be exposed to extreme events. For this reason, researchers have renewed their interests in developing system-level assessment methods as a basis to modern structural and infrastructure performance evaluation and design processes. Specifically, system-level performance metrics and characteristics such as reliability, redundancy, robustness, resilience, and risk continue to be refined. The objective of this paper is to extend the content of the accompanying paper on reliability-based performance indicators for structural members by reviewing proposals for the development and implementation of performance-based criteria for structural systems and infrastructure networks. The paper reviews established concepts of reliability design along with emerging ideas of performance-based and resilience-based design that are especially relevant for assessing and managing system-level risk. The paper also studies structural redundancy and robustness concepts as well as network-level performance metrics along with ranking approaches. Insights from these analyses reveal the need for transitioning structural and infrastructure design processes from a traditional component-level reliability-based approach, to one that seeks uniform levels of risk across scales (from structural systems to interconnected infrastructure networks across communities). Implementation examples are drawn from experiences with buildings, bridges, offshore oil and gas platforms, and a variety of infrastructure systems. The paper also reflects on promising avenues for pursuing practical and calibrated system-level performance indicators that support life cycle performance, safety, reliability, and risk of structural and infrastructure systems as integral parts of resilient communities.},

This algorithm is then used to create a quantitative framework for the resilience characterization of high-pressure natural gas networks. The key concepts are the notions of a network with associated delivery function and delivery importance. No model is available in the literature to measure the performance of high-pressure natural gas networks. In this paper, a new index measuring delivery importance of a gas network is proposed to evaluate the resilience of the entire network. The methodology can be used to consider and quantify the effects of any type of natural disasters such as earthquake and fire, or artificial hazards such as deliberate attacks on the system that may lead to the disruption of the system. The principles and theories applied to the natural gas supply and distribution network in this study can also be applied to other infrastructures that are interconnected and operate as a network, such as the electrical power and water supply and distribution systems. Furthermore, the present paper shows the characteristics of production and demand of natural gas in Iran and provides a data-based estimation of the future growth in production and consumption that is used in assessment of the resilience at a specific time in future.},

These are the ability a) to respond to what happens, b) to monitor critical developments, c) to anticipate future threats and opportunities, and d) to learn from past experience - successes as well as failures. Working with the four abilities provides a structured way of analysing problems and issues, as well as of proposing practical solutions (concepts, tools, and methods). This book is divided into four main sections which describe issues relating to each of the four abilities. The chapters in each section emphasise practical ways of engineering resilience and feature case studies and real applications. The text is written to be easily accessible for readers who are more interested in solutions than in research, but will also be of interest to the latter group.},

A lot of works have been devoted to reveal the robustness of the infrastructure networks against random and malicious attacks. However, real attack scenarios such as earthquakes and typhoons are instead localised attacks which are investigated only recently. Unlike previous studies, we examine in this paper the resilience of infrastructure networks by focusing on the recovery process from localised attacks. We introduce various preferential repair strategies and found that they facilitate and improve network recovery compared to that of random repairs, especially when population size is uneven at different locations. Moreover, our strategic repair methods show similar effectiveness as the greedy repair. The validations are conducted on simulated networks, and on real networks with real disasters. Our method is meaningful in practice as it can largely enhance network resilience and contribute to network risk reduction.},

  abstract = {Building resilience is critical for metropolitan land use planning to strengthen the ability to cope with and minimize climatic disaster risks. Challenges still remain for metropolitan agencies in identifying the components or metrics for measuring resilience. Particularly, uncertainties in climate change and diversification in local contexts compel urban planners to mainstream community participation, indigenous knowledge and local attributes into the resilience assessment. This article aims to propose a novel methodology for assessing resilience, which can encourage stakeholder participation and communicate planners in shaping metropolitan land use policies. Using the Taichung metropolis, Taiwan as the study area, this article created a resilience metric called the Climatic Hazard Resilience Indicators for Localities (CHRIL) that is appropriate for use in a policy context. Then, this metric combined a fuzzy multicriteria decision analysis with a participatory geographic information system approach to measure and map resilience to climatic hazards. Through the participation of experts, local officers and community members, a multivariate analysis was applied to explain why low resilience areas occur in specific locations. Moreover, we performed a cluster analysis to group the areas into several types of resilience and revealed the relationship between the resilience factors and overall local development patterns. Results show that conflicts and tradeoffs may exist between some resilience factors, especially socioeconomic vulnerability and adaptive capacity. The findings provide stakeholders and policy-makers with a better governance structure to design and synthesize appropriate patchworks of planning measures for different types of resilience areas to reduce climatic hazard risks.},

  abstract = {Resilient transportation networks constitute a vital component of urban societies. Even a temporary disruption in the network can paralyze an entire society. Extreme events, such as natural disasters, may have serious destructive impacts on the performance of transportation networks. Reliable performance of transportation systems during an emergency is also critical for a timely, efficient, and successful emergency management operation. Quantitatively analyzing resilience of transportation networks is a critical step toward developing reliable urban societies. Advanced technologies, namely GPS tracking systems, provide rich information about human mobility in urban areas and can be used to monitor traffic patterns. This study proposes a systematic quantitative approach, to develop transportation networks and quantify their topological features using taxi GPS traces. A process control is developed to statistically monitor the topological features of the transportation network through time. Such analysis can allow detection of unusual patterns due to an extreme event and to analyze resilience of the transportation network. This methodology is used to analyze resilience of the New York City transportation network against Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The outcomes of this study will help decision makers analyze resilience of transportation networks, measure and compare destructive impacts of extreme events, and identify vulnerabilities in transportation networks.},

Here, we adopt a deterministic approach to simulate extreme flooding events in two cities, New York City and Chicago, by removing entire sections of road systems using U.S. FEMA floodplains. We then measure changes in the number of real trips that can be completed (using travel demand data), Geographical Information Systems properties, and network topological indicators. We notably measure and discuss how betweenness centrality is being redistributed after flooding. Broadly, robustness in spatial systems like road networks is dependent on many factors, including system size (number of nodes and links) and topological structure of the network. Expectedly, robustness also depends on geography, and cities that are naturally more at risk will tend to be less robust, and therefore the notion of robustness rapidly becomes sensitive to individual contexts.},

This article reviews the indicators proposed in the literature and assesses the quality of these indicators. Furthermore, a multi-linear fit of the indicators is made to find a better, combined, indicator to rank the links according to their vulnerability. The article shows that different indicators assess different links to be vulnerable. Also combined they cannot predict the vulnerability of a link.

  abstract = {This paper proposes and tests a multilayer framework for simulating the network dynamics of inter-organizational coordination among interdependent infrastructure systems (IISs) in resilience planning. Inter-organizational coordination among IISs (such as transportation, flood control, and emergency management) would greatly affect the effectiveness of resilience planning. Hence, it is important to examine and understand the dynamics of coordination in networks of organizations within and across various systems in resilience planning. To capture the dynamic nature of coordination frequency and the heterogeneity of organizations, this paper proposes a multilayer network simulation framework enabling the characterization of inter-organizational coordination dynamics within and across IISs. In the proposed framework, coordination probabilities are utilized to approximate the varying levels of collaboration among organizations. Based on these derived collaborations, the simulation process perturbs intra-layer or inter-layer links and unveils the level of inter-organizational coordination within and across IISs. To test the proposed framework, the study examined a multilayer collaboration network of 35 organizations from five infrastructure systems within Harris County, Texas, based on the data gathered from a survey in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The results indicate that prior to Hurricane Harvey: (1) coordination among organizations across different infrastructure systems is less than the coordination within the individual systems; (2) organizations from the community development system had a low level of coordination for hazard mitigation with organizations in flood control and transportation systems; (3) achieving a greater level of coordination among organizations across infrastructure systems is more difficult and would require a greater frequency of interaction (compared to within-system coordination). The results show the capability of the proposed multilayer network simulation framework to examine inter-organizational coordination dynamics at the system level (e.g., within and across IISs). The assessment of inter-organizational coordination within and across IISs sheds light on important organizational interdependencies in IISs and leads to recommendations for improving the resilience planning process.},

The average indoor temperatures in summer and winter are 28~°C and 16~°C respectively. The indoor thermal environment of rural buildings is usually poor and cannot meet the requirements of Chinese standards. At the same time, the architectural design and energy consumption pattern of rural households are different from those in urban areas as countryside has unique characteristics.

The proposed method could obtain a set of general optimal restoration schedules in an efficient manner, so that decision-makers could make a final choice by weighting other preferences and experience. In the methodology, a new travel speed-based metric is introduced for performance assessment of transportation network, and three normalised independent indicators are developed to characterise network resilience from the perspective of functionality curve. Furthermore, a bi-objective optimisation model based on the recovery trajectory is recommended to search for non-dominated optimal restoration schedules. To illustrate the proposed method, heuristic algorithms are used to solve the restoration schedule optimisation problem of a hypothetical transportation network.},

Our focus is on what resilience does on the ground in relation to development, adaptation and disaster management, and on identifying critical issues for engaging with equity in resilience practice. Using techniques from systematic reviews, with variants of equitable resilience as our key search terms, we carried out an analytical literature review which reveals four interconnected themes: subjectivities, inclusion, cross-scale interactions, and transformation. Drawing on this analysis, we find that ‘equitable resilience’ is increasingly likely when resilience practice takes into account issues of social vulnerability and differential access to power, knowledge, and resources; it requires starting from people’s own perception of their position within their human-environmental system, and it accounts for their realities and for their need for a change of circumstance to avoid imbalances of power into the future. Our approach moves beyond debates that focus on the ontological disconnect between resilience and social theory, to provide a definition that can be used in practice alongside resilience indicators to drive ground level interventions towards equitable outcomes. Defined in this way, equitable resilience is able to support the development of social-ecological systems that are contextually rooted, responsive to change and socially just, and thus relevant to global sustainability challenges.},

  abstract = {The transport system is critical to the welfare of modern societies. This article provides an overview of recent research on vulnerability and resilience of transport systems. Definitions of vulnerability and resilience are formulated and discussed together with related concepts. In the increasing and extensive literature of transport vulnerability studies, two distinct traditions are identified. One tradition with roots in graph theory studies the vulnerability of transport networks based on their topological properties. The other tradition also represents the demand and supply side of the transport systems to allow for a more complete assessment of the consequences of disruptions or disasters for the users and society. The merits and drawbacks of the approaches are discussed. The concept of resilience offers a broader socio-technical perspective on the transport system’s capacity to maintain or quickly recover its function after a disruption or a disaster. The transport resilience literature is less abundant, especially concerning the post-disaster phases of response and recovery. The research on transport system vulnerability and resilience is now a mature field with a developed methodology and a large amount of research findings with large potential practical usefulness. The authors argue that more cross-disciplinary collaborations between authorities, operators and researchers would be desirable to transform this knowledge into practical strategies to strengthen the resilience of the transport system.},

Resilience is important for daily events, such as vehicle crashes, and more extreme events, such as hurricanes and terrorist attacks. Transportation resilience has ten dimensions: redundancy, diversity, efficiency, autonomous components, strength, collaboration, adaptability, mobility, safety, and the ability to recover quickly. This paper examines the influence of the system optimal and user equilibrium traffic assignments on the last four dimensions. No widely accepted measurement of resilience is available for transportation systems; this paper presents multiple metrics for the four examined contributing components that will aid future development of a single measure of resilience. An application of these measures to a test network found that user equilibrium results in better adaptability and safety while system optimum yields better mobility and faster recovery},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of some of the recent developments in the assessment of network vulnerability and robustness through appropriate tools that assist in the quantification of network efficiency/performance and the identification of the importance of network components, such as nodes and links. We demonstrated how rigorously constructed and well-defined network measures can capture not only the network topology underlying a particular critical system, but also the underlying behavior of decision-makers, the resulting flows, and induced costs in the reality of demands for resources, whether fixed or elastic (price-dependent). In addition, we reviewed how to determine the synergy associated with network integration, with a focus on supply chains, as may occur not only in corporate applications, such as in mergers and acquisitions, but also in humanitarian ones, as in the case of the creation of teams and partnerships for humanitarian logistics. We illustrated the concepts and tools in this paper, which are based on numerous publications, through a spectrum of applications and numerical examples. Because the number of disasters is growing globally, it is imperative to have transparent, well-understood, and appropriate tools for the determination of network vulnerability and robustness, as critical infrastructure networks from transportation, telecommunications, supply chains, to financial and electric power ones, provide the ties that bind our economies and societies together. Local disruptions can have global impacts. Only when network components are identified as to their importance and rankings can decision-makers and policy analysts, as well as planners and engineers, understand in an objective way which components should be maintained and protected the most, with implications for disaster and emergency preparedness as well as national security.},

In order to better assess the vulnerability of these structures, this study showcases the outcome of an observational analysis that utilizes biomimetical (bio-inspired) machine learning algorithms to predict the vulnerability and expected degree of damage in bridges in the aftermath of an extreme loading event (such as fire, flood, earthquake, etc.). These algorithms comprise deep learning, decision tree, genetic algorithm and genetic programing and were trained and validated using 299 international incidents covering a wide variety of bridge systems/configurations, traffic demands, etc. Based on this analysis, user-friendly assessment tools that can be used to evaluate propensity of a given bridge to undergo high levels of damage and/or collapse are developed. These tools can aid designers and decision-makers in evaluating performance of new or existing bridges against a variety of hazards, as well as in developing relevant design strategies for mitigating disaster-induced failures as to minimize disruptions to supply chain operations and/or evacuations during an emergency.},

Resilience in these networks was evaluated alongside that of a biological network, which through millions of years of evolution had developed an adaptive behavior in which cost, efficiency, and resilience were optimized in the feeding network that was constructed. Disruptions in the networks were simulated by using link-based targeted and random strategies. With simulation results, network performance under disruption was assessed by using two metrics: global efficiency and the relative size of the giant component for each disruption strategy. The biological network exhibits superior resistance to disruption regardless of strategy, a quality attributed to its redundant and cyclic weblike network structure and its innate ability to adapt to disruptions by developing network structures that have been honed through millions of years of evolution. In addition, linear correlations between network structural metrics such as the average degree, density, and average clustering coefficient were explored and analyzed.},

This paper adapts an existing resilience assessment framework for single systems to interdependent systems and mainly focuses on modeling and resilience contribution analysis of multi-systems’ joint restoration processes, which are seldom addressed in the literature. Taking interdependent power and gas systems in Houston, Texas, USA under hurricane hazards as an illustrative exmaple, five types of joint restoration stategies are proposed, including random restoration strategy RS1, independent restoration strategy RS2, power first and gas second restoration strategy RS3, gas aimed restoration strategy RS4, and power and gas compromised restoration strategy RS5. Results show that under limited restoration resources, RS1 produces the least resilience for both systems, RS2 and RS3 both generates the largest power system resilience while RS4 is the best for the gas system; and if quantifying the total resilience as the evenly weighted sum of two systems’ individual resilience, RS5 produces the largest total resilience. The proposed method can help decision makers search optimum joint restoration strategy, which can significantly enhance both systems’ resilience.},

Despite their national importance, the complexity of large-scale transport networks means that we do not fully understand their vulnerabilities to cascade failures. The research conducted through this paper examines the interdependent rail networks in Greater London and surrounding commuter area. We focus on the morning commuter hours, where the system is under the most demand stress. There is increasing evidence that the topological shape of the network plays an important role in dynamic cascades. Here, we examine whether the different topological measures of resilience (stability) or robustness (failure) are more appropriate for understanding poor railway performance. The results show that resilience, not robustness, has a strong correlation with the consumer experience statistics. Our results are a way of describing the complexity of cascade dynamics on networks without the involvement of detailed agent-based models, showing that cascade effects are more responsible for poor performance than failures. The network science analysis hints at pathways towards making the network structure more resilient by reducing feedback loops.},

  abstract = {Infrastructures are needed for maintaining functionality and stability of society, while being put under substantial stresses from natural or man-made shocks. Since avoiding shock is impossible, increased focus is given to infrastructure resilience, which denotes the ability to recover and operate under new stable regimes. This paper addresses the problem of estimating, quantifying and planning for economic resilience of interdependent infrastructures, where interconnectedness adds to problem complexity. The risk-based economic input–output model enterprise, a useful tool for measuring the cascading effects of interdependent failures, is employed to introduce a framework for economic resilience estimation. We propose static and dynamic measures for resilience that confirm to well-known resilience concepts of robustness, rapidity, redundancy, and resourcefulness. The quantitative metrics proposed here (static resilience metric, time averaged level of operability, maximum loss of functionality, time to recovery) guide a preparedness decision making framework to promote interdependent economic resilience estimation. Using the metrics we introduce new multi-dimensional resilience functions that allow multiple resource allocation scenarios. Through an example problem we demonstrate the usefulness of these functions in guiding resource planning for building resilience.},

  abstract = {Climate change and natural hazards pose great threats to road transport systems which are ‘lifelines’ of human society. However, there is generally a lack of empirical data and approaches for assessing resilience of road networks in real hazard events. This study introduces an empirical approach to evaluate road network resilience using crowdsourced traffic data in Google Maps. Based on the conceptualization of resilience and the Hansen accessibility index, resilience of road network is measured from accumulated accessibility reduction over time during a hazard. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in a case study of the Cleveland metropolitan area (Ohio) in Winter Storm Harper. The results reveal strong spatial variations of the disturbance and recovery rate of road network performance during the hazard. The major findings of the case study are: (1) longer distance travels have higher increasing ratios of travel time during the hazard; (2) communities with low accessibility at the normal condition have lower road network resilience; (3) spatial clusters of low resilience are identified, including communities with low socio-economic capacities. The introduced approach provides ground-truth validation for existing quantitative models and supports disaster management and transportation planning to reduce hazard impacts on road network.},

It offers a rigorous definition of economic resilience and an operational metric, and it shows how they can be applied to measuring and applying the concept to private and public decision making. Major dimensions of resilience and their implications for human development are explored. Resilience is emphasized as a coping mechanism for dealing with short-term crises, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. As well, the author shows how lessons learned in the short-run out of necessity and through the application of human ingenuity can be incorporated into long-run sustainability practices. In part, this opportunity stems from viewing resilience as a process, one that enhances individual and societal competencies. The book links economic resilience to several other disciplines and examines the relationship between resilience and various other key concepts such as vulnerability, adaptation, and sustainability. It scrutinizes the measurement of economic resilience in terms of temporal, spatial, and scale dimensions. It examines the time-path of resilience and relates it to the recovery process.This work also looks closely at progress on the formulation of resilience indices and stresses the importance of actionable variables. It presents a risk-management framework, including aspects of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, it explores the role of resilience in relation to the co-benefits of disaster risk management.},

  abstract = {Risk-based performance indicators offer valuable information on the performance of spatially distributed systems, such as highway bridge networks, whose functionality is vital for economic and social purposes. In this paper, the time-dependent expected losses of deteriorated highway bridge networks are investigated. A five-state Markov model is used to predict the time-dependent performance of bridges. The direct consequences are assessed on the basis of scenarios characterized by individual bridge failures and maintenance shutdowns. The indirect consequences are quantified on the basis of scenarios characterized by single and multiple bridges out-of-service, by solving the traffic assignment problem. The variation of direct, indirect and total expected losses in time is computed. The proposed methodology is suitable for the assessment of losses due to the service loads and the effects of deterioration. The proposed approach is illustrated on a highway bridge network. The results indicate that the maximum total expected indirect loss is much higher than the maximum total expected direct loss. The expected loss profiles show a pattern that first increases and then decreases due to the time-variation of the Markov chain state probabilities.},

This paper presents a new, comprehensive, system-wide approach to identifying critical links and evaluating network performance. The approach considers network flows, link capacity and network topology. Moreover, it relies on readily available sources of data. Using three hypothetical networks, we demonstrate that the approach, known as the Network Robustness Index, yields different highway planning solutions than the traditional V/C ratio. Moreover, these solutions yield far greater system-wide benefits, as measured by travel-time savings, than solutions identified by the V/C ratio.},

  abstract = {Resilience is a multi-faceted concept frequently used across a wide range of disciplines, practices, and sectors. There is a growing recognition of the utility of resilience as a bridging concept that can facilitate inter-and transdisciplinary approaches to tackle complexities inherent in decision making under conditions of risk and uncertainty. Such conditions are common in urban planning, infrastructure planning, asset management, emergency planning, crisis management, and development processes where systemic interdependencies and interests at stake influence decisions and outcomes. A major challenge that can undermine the use of resilience for guiding planning activities is the value-laden and contested nature of the concept that can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Because resilience is context-specific and generally depends on local aspirations, this issue can be partially tackled by adopting participatory approaches for the conceptualization of resilience. This paper provides an example of how co-design methods can be employed for conceptualizing resilience. The Structured Interview Matrix was used as a technique to facilitate discussions among a diverse group of researchers and practitioners attending the International Workshop on Tools and Indicators for Assessing Urban Resilience.

In order to do this the following questions need to be addressed: How is robustness defined? Against which disturbances should the network be made robust? Which factors determine the robustness of a road network? What is the relationship between robustness, travel times and travel time reliability? Which indicators can be used to quantify robustness? How can these indicators be computed? This paper addresses these questions by developing a consistent framework for robustness in which a definition, terms related to robustness, indicators and an evaluation method are included. By doing this, policy makers and transportation analyst are offered a framework to discuss issues that are related to road network robustness and vulnerability which goes beyond the disconnected definitions, indicators and evaluation methods used so far in literature. Furthermore, the evaluation method that is presented for evaluating the robustness of the road network against short term variations in supply (like incidents) contributes to the problem of designing robust road networks because it has a relatively short computation time and it takes spillback effects and alternative routes into account.},

They turn out to be good abstractions of the intricate connectivity of multimodal transportation networks, among other types of complex systems. One of the most important critical phenomena arising in such networks is the emergence of congestion in transportation flows. Here, we prove analytically that the structure of multiplex networks can induce congestion for flows that otherwise would be decongested if the individual layers were not interconnected. We provide explicit equations for the onset of congestion and approximations that allow us to compute this onset from individual descriptors of the individual layers. The observed cooperative phenomenon is reminiscent of Braess’ paradox in which adding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. Similarly, in the multiplex structure, the efficiency in transportation can unbalance the transportation loads resulting in unexpected congestion.},

High-impact-zone location identification metrics were developed and implemented in preliminarily identifying areas affected by bridge closures. Resilience was estimated, and an index developed by utilizing practical functionality metrics based on vehicle distance and hours traveled. These are illustrated for the Tampa Bay, Florida, area. Findings for 10 bridge closure scenarios and recovery schemas indicated significant regional resilience losses. The I-275 bridge closure indicated the highest functional loss to the regional network: the aggregated resilience index below 0.5 reflects severe network performance deficit and mobility limitations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel resilience-based framework to optimise the scheduling of the post-disaster recovery actions for road-bridge transportation networks. The methodology systematically incorporates network topology, redundancy, traffic flow, damage level and available resources into the stochastic processes of network post-hazard recovery strategy optimisation. Two metrics are proposed for measuring rapidity and efficiency of the network recovery: total recovery time (TRT) and the skew of the recovery trajectory (SRT). The TRT is the time required for the network to be restored to its pre-hazard functionality level, while the SRT is a metric defined for the first time in this study to capture the characteristics of the recovery trajectory that relates to the efficiency of those restoration strategies considered. Based on this two-dimensional metric, a restoration scheduling method is proposed for optimal post-disaster recovery planning for bridge-road transportation networks. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a genetic algorithm is used to solve the restoration schedule optimisation problem for a hypothetical bridge network with 30 nodes and 37 bridges subjected to a scenario seismic event. A sensitivity study using this network illustrates the impact of the resourcefulness of a community and its time-dependent commitment of resources on the network recovery time and trajectory.},
