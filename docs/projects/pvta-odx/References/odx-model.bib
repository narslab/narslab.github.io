  abstract = {In this work, we present methods to estimate average daily origin–destination trips from triangulated mobile phone records of millions of anonymized users. These records are first converted into clustered locations at which users engage in activities for an observed duration. These locations are inferred to be home, work, or other depending on observation frequency, day of week, and time of day, and represent a user’s origins and destinations. Since the arrival time and duration at these locations reflect the observed (based on phone usage) rather than true arrival time and duration of a user, we probabilistically infer departure time using survey data on trips in major US cities. Trips are then constructed for each user between two consecutive observations in a day. These trips are multiplied by expansion factors based on the population of a user’s home Census Tract and divided by the number of days on which we observed the user, distilling average daily trips. Aggregating individuals’ daily trips by Census Tract pair, hour of the day, and trip purpose results in trip matrices that form the basis for much of the analysis and modeling that inform transportation planning and investments. The applicability of the proposed methodology is supported by validation against the temporal and spatial distributions of trips reported in local and national surveys.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, several techniques have been developed for using smart card fare data to estimate origin–destination (O-D) matrices for public transport. In the past, different walking distance and allowable transfer time assumptions had been applied because of a lack of information about the alighting stop for a trip. Such assumptions can significantly affect the accuracy of the estimated O-D matrices. Little evidence demonstrates the accuracy of O-D pairs estimated with smart card fare data. Unique smart card fare data from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, offered an opportunity to assess previous methods and their assumptions. South East Queensland data were used to study the effects of different assumptions on estimated O-D matrices and to conduct a sensitivity analysis for different parameters. In addition, an algorithm was proposed for generating an O-D matrix from individual user transactions (trip legs). About 85\% of the transfer time was non-walking time (wait and short activity time). More than 90\% of passengers walked less than 10 min to transfer between alighting and the next boarding stop; this time represented about 10\% of the allowable transfer time. A change in the assumed allowable transfer time from 15 to 90 min had a minor effect on the estimated O-D matrices. Most passengers returned to within 800 m of their first origin on the same day.},

  abstract = {Smart card data are increasingly used for transit network planning, passengers’ behaviour analysis and network demand forecasting. Public transport origin–destination (O–D) estimation is a significant product of processing smart card data. In recent years, various O–D estimation methods using the trip-chaining approach have attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. However, the validity of these estimation methods has not been extensively investigated. This is mainly because these datasets usually lack data about passengers’ alighting, as passengers are often required to tap their smart cards only when boarding a public transport service. Thus, this paper has two main objectives. First, the paper reports on the implementation and validation of the existing O–D estimation method using the unique smart card dataset of the South-East Queensland public transport network which includes data on both boarding stops and alighting stops. Second, the paper improves the O–D estimation algorithm and empirically examines these improvements, relying on this unique dataset. The evaluation of the last destination assumption of the trip-chaining method shows a significant negative impact on the matching results of the differences between actual boarding/alighting times and the public transport schedules. The proposed changes to the algorithm improve the average distance between the actual and estimated alighting stops, as this distance is reduced from 806m using the original algorithm to 530m after applying the suggested improvements.},

  abstract = {Fast urbanization generates increasing amounts of travel flows, urging the need for efficient transport planning policies. In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region. From our results, we observe different mobility patterns for road and rail modes and between Paris and its suburbs. The resulting transport flows are extensively validated against the travel survey and the travel card data for different spatial scales.},

We adopt a novel Bayesian framework to develop a class of models that explicitly cast trip configurations in the study region as random variables. As a consequence, classical solutions from growth factor, gravity, and maximum entropy models are identified to specific estimators under the proposed models. We show that each of these solutions usually account for only a small fraction of the posterior probability mass in the ensemble and we then contend that the uncertainty in the inference should be propagated to later analyses or next-stage models. We also propose alternative, more robust estimators and devise Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes to obtain them and perform other types of inference. We present several examples showcasing the proposed models and approach, and highlight how other sources of data can be incorporated in the model and inference in a principled, non-heuristic way.},

Most existing Bayesian methods adopt prior OD matrixes, which are always troublesome to be obtained. Since transportation systems normally have stored large amounts of historical link flows, a Bayesian network model using these prior link flows is proposed. Based on some observed link flows, the estimation results are updated. Under normal distribution assumption, the proposed Bayesian network model considers the level of total traffic flow, the variability of link flows, and the violation of the traffic flow conservation law. Both the point estimation and the corresponding probability intervals can be provided by this model. To solve the Bayesian network model, a specific procedure which can avoid matrix inversion is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed Bayesian network method. The results show that the proposed method has a high accuracy and practical applicability.},

  abstract = {Automatic Data Collection (ADC systems can enhance the ability of transit agencies to obtain useful planning information that was previously too expensive to obtain. This thesis documents the development of an algorithm to estimate a Bus Passenger Trip Origin-Destination Matrix (OD Matrix) based on ADC system archived data including Automated Fare Collection (AFC data, Automatic Passenger Count (APC data, and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data. This algorithm consists of three steps: data preparation, estimation of a Single Route OD Matrices for all routes, and estimation of a Network Level OD Matrix using transfer flow information. The single route OD matrix estimation requires the development of a "seed" matrix derived primarily from AFC data and the "marginal" control totals, i.e. the boarding and alighting counts, derived primarily from APC data. Both Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (LE) techniques are used to estimate the single route OD matrices based on seed matrices and marginal values, and the results from these two techniques are compared. For the network level OD matrix estimation, we estimate the transfer flows by considering the consecutive transactions from AFC data.},

To estimate OD matrices while protecting privacy, this study uses aggregated data of mobile phone traces to estimate work-related trips. The proposed approach is a sequential updater based on the maximum entropy principle. Trip production and attraction are firstly calculated by a non-linear programming problem followed by a matrix fitting problem to distribute trips to each OD pair. Numerical study shows that updated values are much closer to the synthesize real values than the referred ones. The case study in Tokyo further demonstrates that the proposed updating approach can track the change of travel pattern.},

  abstract = {Estimation of origin–destination (O–D) matrices from link count data is considered. This problem is challenging because the number of parameters to be estimated is typically larger than the number of network links. As a result, it is (usually) impossible to identify a unique optimal estimate of the O–D matrix from mean link traffic counts. However, information from the covariance matrix of link count data collected over a sequence of days can relieve this problem of indeterminacy. This fact is illustrated through a simple example. The use of second-order statistical properties of the data in O–D matrix estimation is then explored, and a class of estimators proposed. Practical problems of model mis-specification are discussed and some avenues for future research outlined.},

  abstract = {We consider inference for the matrix of origin-destination (O-D) trip rates for a transit system, based on counts of the passengers boarding and alighting at each stop. The observed data provide only indirect information about the O-D rates through a highly indeterminate system of linear equations. Enumeration of the solution set of feasible trips is necessary to calculate the model likelihood, but this would be computationally prohibitive for even moderately large systems. We therefore adopt a sampling-based Bayesian approach. Existing work on the wider problem of O-D traffic rate estimation for general transport networks has failed to produce an efficient sampling methodology for sizeable applications; however, we were able to derive a suitable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm by generating candidate trip vectors directly from the feasible set using a Markov model of passenger behavior. The resulting sampler moves freely around the posterior support without the need for any explicit specification of the feasible trip set. This methodology is applicable regardless of whether or not the O-D matrix is assumed to have any given structure. We illustrate our methods with a case study on O-D trip rates for a bus service in San Francisco Bay.},

  abstract = {The transport sector is often the center of political and scientific debate on sustainability due to negative externalities produced by the daily movement of goods and people which impact both on the environment and on quality of life. Great interest has therefore focused on impact estimation of transport infrastructures/services with respect to social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Among the consolidated assessment methods, the cost–benefit analysis (CBA) is one of the quantitative tools representing the final stage (decision) in decision-making processes, which compares design alternatives and verifies the sustainability of a transport project. Recently the Italian Government proposed the national “Guidelines for Assessment of Investment Projects” based on CBA. The aim of this research is twofold: a) from a research point of view, to propose a sustainable evaluating method for impact assessment of the new transportation infrastructure aimed in performing both rational and shared decisions with the territories; b) for a practical point of view, to propose a first application of the CBA Italian guideline useful for the professional practice in the field of public investment evaluation. A quantitative impacts assessment of social, economic and environmental sustainability was performed for a revamping project of a new “greenway” in the south of Italy. Furthermore, also the social equity impacts produced by the new road infrastructure was also quantified, estimating the GINI indexes variation as a measure of effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The automated fare collection (AFC) system has gained increasing popularity among transit systems worldwide. The AFC system is usually an entry-only system that only records the serial number of the smart card and the transaction time of each use. Neither the AFC data nor the bus global positioning system (GPS) could reveal the passenger’s alighting information, namely, alighting time and station. Hence, the station-to-station origin-destination (OD) trip information cannot be obtained directly from the available data sources. To address this problem, this paper proposes a methodology that estimates the OD matrix by using smart card and GPS data. In this paper, the characteristics of the basic data sources are first analyzed, based on which the bus arrival time is generated using the density-based clustering algorithm and a time correction strategy, based on which the passenger’s boarding station is identified. The alighting stations are inferred based on the characteristics of bus trip chaining, which could identify over 80\% of the alighting stations on average. Finally, the proposed methodology is verified by a comprehensive field survey in Suzhou, China, with 100\% sample rate.},

CDR, which consist of time stamped tower locations with caller IDs, are analyzed first and trips occurring within certain time windows are used to generate tower-to-tower transient OD matrices for different time periods. These are then associated with corresponding nodes of the traffic network and converted to node-to-node transient OD matrices. The actual OD matrices are derived by scaling up these node-to-node transient OD matrices. An optimization based approach, in conjunction with a microscopic traffic simulation platform, is used to determine the scaling factors that result best matches with the observed traffic counts. The methodology is demonstrated using CDR from 2.87 million users of Dhaka, Bangladesh over a month and traffic counts from 13 key locations over 3 days of that month. The applicability of the methodology is supported by a validation study.},

  abstract = {An iterative method is proposed to estimate bus route origin-destination (OD) passenger flow matrices from boarding and alighting data for time-of-day periods in the absence of good a priori estimates of the flows. The algorithm is based on the widely used iterative proportional fitting (IPF) method and takes advantage of the large quantities of boarding and alighting data that are routinely collected by transit agencies using automatic passenger count (APC) technologies. An arbitrarily chosen OD matrix can be used as the base matrix required to initialize the algorithm, and the IPF method is applied with bus trip-level boarding and alighting data and the base matrix to produce an estimate of the OD flow matrix for each bus trip. The trip-level OD flow matrices are then aggregated to produce an estimate of the period-level OD flow matrix, which in turn is used as the base matrix for the following iteration. The process is repeated until convergence. Empirical results are conducted on operational bus routes using APC data collected during multiple season-years, where directly observed OD passenger flows are available to represent the ground truth. In all cases in which APC data are available for even a reasonably small number of bus trips, the iteratively improved base method produces better estimates than the application of the traditional IPF method when using a null base matrix, which is commonly adopted in the absence of a priori information without updating. Moreover, the algorithm converges in minimal computational time to the same estimates regardless of the initializing matrices used.},

These datasets offer opportunities to infer good estimates of passenger origin–destination (OD) flows. In this study, a method is proposed to estimate transit route passenger OD flow matrices for time-of-day periods based on OD flow information derived from labor-intensive onboard surveys and the large quantities of APC data that are becoming available. The computational feasibility of the proposed method is established and its accuracy is empirically evaluated using differences between the estimated OD flows and ground-truth observations on an operational bus route. To interpret the empirical differences from the ground-truth estimates, differences are also computed when using the state-of-the-practice Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) method to estimate the OD flows. The empirical results show that when using sufficient quantities of boarding and alighting data that can be readily obtained from APC-equipped buses, the estimates determined by the proposed method are better than those determined by the IPF method when no or a small sample sized onboard OD flow survey dataset is available and of similar quality to those determined by the IPF method when a large sample sized onboard OD flow survey dataset is available. Therefore, the proposed method offers the opportunity to forgo conducting costly onboard surveys for the purpose of OD flow estimation.},

  abstract = {The fundamental challenge of the origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation problem is that it is severely under-determined. In this paper we propose a new data driven OD estimation method for cases where a supply pattern in the form of speeds and flows is available. We show that with these input data, we do not require an iterative dynamic network loading procedure that results in an equilibrium assignment, nor do we need an assumption on the kind of equilibrium that emerges from this process. The minimal number of ingredients which are needed are (a) a method to estimate/predict production and attraction time series; (b) a method to compute the N shortest paths from each OD zone to the next; and (c) two—possibly OD-specific—assumptions on the magnitude of N; and on the proportionality of path flows between these origins and destinations, respectively. The latter constitutes the most important behavioral assumption in our method, which relates to how we assume travelers have chosen their routes between OD pairs. We choose a proportionality factor that is inversely proportional to realized travel time, where we incorporate a penalty for path overlap. For large networks, these ingredients may be insufficient to solve the resulting system of equations. We show how additional constraints can be derived directly from the data by using principal component analysis, with which we exploit the fact that temporal patterns of production and attraction are similar across the network. Experimental results on a toy network and a large city network (Santander, Spain) show that our OD estimation method works satisfactorily, given a reasonable choice of N, and the use of so-called 3D supply patterns, which provide a compact representation of the supply dynamics over the entire network. Inclusion of topological information makes the method scalable both in terms of network size and for different topologies. Although we use a neural network to predict production and attraction in our experiments (which implies ground-truth OD data were needed), there are straight-forward paths to improve the method using additional data, such as demographic data, household survey data, social media and or movement traces, which could support estimating such ground-truth baseline production and attraction patterns. The proposed framework would fit very nicely in an online traffic modeling and control framework, and we see many paths to further refine and improve the method.},

  abstract = {The daily trip to work is ubiquitous, yet its characteristics differ widely from person to person and place to place. This is manifested in statistics on mode and distance of travel, which vary depending on a range of factors that operate at different scales. This heterogeneity is problematic for decision makers tasked with encouraging more sustainable commuter patterns. Numerical models, based on real commuting data, have great potential to aid the decision making process. However, we contend that new approaches are needed to advance knowledge about the social and geographical factors that relate to the diversity of commuter patterns, if policies targeted to specific individuals or places are to be effective. To this end, the paper presents a spatial microsimulation approach, which combines individual-level survey data with geographically aggregated census results to tackle the problem. This method overcomes the limitations imposed by the lack of available geocoded micro-data. Further, it allows a range of scales of analysis to be pursued in parallel and provides insights into both the types of area and individual that would benefit most from specific interventions.},

  abstract = {So-called tap-in–tap-off smart card data have become increasingly available and popular as a result of the deployment of automatic fare collection systems on transit systems in many cities and areas worldwide. An opportunity to obtain much more accurate transit demand data than before has thus been opened to both researchers and practitioners. However, given that travelers in some cases can choose different origin and destination stations, as well as different transit lines, depending on their personal acceptable walking distances, being able to aggregate the demand of spatially close stations becomes essential when transit demand matrices are constructed. With the aim of investigating such problems using data-driven approaches, this paper proposes a k-means-based station aggregation method that can quantitatively determine the partitioning by considering both flow and spatial distance information. The method was applied to a case study of Haaglanden, Netherlands, with a specified objective of maximizing the ratio of average intra-cluster flow to average inter-cluster flow while maintaining the spatial compactness of all clusters. With a range of clustering of different K performed first using the distance feature, a distance-based metric and a flow-based metric were then computed and ultimately combined to determine the optimal number of clusters. The transit demand matrices constructed by implementing this method lay a foundation for further studies on short-term transit demand prediction and demand assignment.},

  abstract = {The advent of automatic passenger counter (APC) technologies is resulting in the collection of comprehensive boarding and alighting data on an ongoing basis across transit networks. The availability of APC data offers a new opportunity to determine origin–destination (O-D) flows on a frequent and comprehensive basis. In this paper, the performance of a simple procedure for route-level O-D flow determination requiring only boarding and alighting data is investigated. Specifically, the performance of the iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure used with a null base matrix is examined on the basis of a field experiment in which true O-D flows are observed. Because of the noninformative nature of the null matrix, using the IPF procedure with the null matrix as its input base may not be expected to produce good results. In a comparison of empirical results with those produced by other benchmark procedures, the IPF–null procedure is found to perform surprisingly well. The quality of the resulting matrices appears to be roughly similar to that of matrices derived from an onboard survey, the benchmark for what has been achieved in practice, but at much higher cost. The results indicate that much can be gained from using readily available APC data, even when the simple IPF–null procedure is applied. Moreover, using the better base obtained from an onboard survey with the IPF procedure improved performance, but less markedly compared with use of the null base; this difference indicates that combining onboard survey information with APC data provides a better O-D matrix than what can be derived from an onboard survey alone, even when the simple IPF procedure is used.},

  abstract = {In recent years there have been many advances in understanding how transportation can promote or detract from sustainability. The role of public transit has been established as a critical element in promoting sustainable and vibrant cities. While decision making tools, such as composite indices, have been developed to understand overall urban and transportation sustainability, few tools exist to directly analyze public transit systems based on sustainability criteria.This paper introduces the Public Transit Sustainable Mobility Analysis Tool (PTSMAT) framework, which uses composite sustainability index techniques along with research into transport sustainability to propose a new transit analysis tool that can be used in both planning/decision making and research contexts. First, this paper reviews definitions of sustainability and sustainable transport, and sustainability analysis tools and relates them back to a legible analytic framework for public transit systems. Next, the PTMSAT framework is introduced along with a description of its data collection, data analysis, and index calculation processes. The application of PTSMAT to decision making and research scenarios is also outlined. A summary of relevant indicators for public transits sustainability and integrates them into the PTSMAT framework using a quadruple bottom line approach. Next, a case study of the framework's application is provided for the UBC Corridor study in Vancouver, Canada. This case study demonstrates how the tool may be used to inform decision making and planning efforts.}

  abstract = {As fare and data collection technology has developed, the resolution of collected data has reached the level of the individual traveler in investigations of transit passenger behavior. This paper investigates the use of these data to estimate passenger origins and destinations at the level of individual stops. Because of a lack of information from the fare collection system, researchers still need some estimate of passengers' alighting stops to complete each passenger trip chain on a specific day. Automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL) systems are the inputs to the estimation. Instead of typical AVL data, the paper proposes two models to estimate the alighting stop; both consider passenger trip chaining by using AFC data, transit schedule data (Google's General Transit Feed Specification), and automated passenger counter (APC) data. The paper validates the model by comparing the output to APC data with vehicle location data (APC-VL) and performs sensitivity analyses on several parameters in the models. To detect transfer trips, the new models propose a submodel that takes into account the effect of service headway in addition to some typical transfer time thresholds. Another contribution of this study is the relative relaxation of the search in finding the boarding stops, which enables the alternative algorithm to detect and fix possible errors in identification of the boarding stop for a transaction. As a result, the paper provides algorithms for the proposed models and sensitivity analysis for several predefined scenarios. The results are based on data and observed bus passenger behavior in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota, area.},

Inicialmente, define-se o problema da estimação, enfatizando sua natureza subes­pecificada, o que levou ao desenvolvimento de vários modelos baseados em diferentes abordagens.

  abstract = {The majority of origin destination (OD) matrix estimation methods focus on situations where weak or partial information, derived from sample travel surveys, is available. Information derived from travel census studies, in contrast, covers the entire population of a specific study area of interest. In such cases where reliable historical data exist, statistical methodology may serve as a flexible alternative to traditional travel demand models by incorporating estimation of trip-generation, trip-attraction and trip-distribution in one model. In this research, a statistical Bayesian approach on OD matrix estimation is presented, where modeling of OD flows derived from census data, is related only to a set of general explanatory variables. A Poisson and a negative binomial model are formulated in detail, while emphasis is placed on the hierarchical Poisson-gamma structure of the latter. Problems related to the absence of closed-form expressions are bypassed with the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method known as the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. The methodology is tested on a realistic application area concerning the Belgian region of Flanders on the level of municipalities. Model comparison indicates that negative binomial likelihood is a more suitable distributional assumption than Poisson likelihood, due to the great degree of overdispersion present in OD flows. Finally, several predictive goodness-of-fit tests on the negative binomial model suggest a good overall fit to the data. In general, Bayesian methodology reduces the overall uncertainty of the estimates by delivering posterior distributions for the parameters of scientific interest as well as predictive distributions for future OD flows.},

These comparisons always aim at measuring the accuracy with which the models reproduce the mobility described by origin–destination matrices. This has been done at different spatial scales using different datasets, and several versions of the models have been proposed to adjust to various spatial systems. However, the models, to our knowledge, have never been compared with respect to policy testing scenarios. For this reason, here we use the models to analyse the impact of the introduction of a new transportation network, a bus rapid transport system, in the city of Teresina in Brazil. We do this by measuring the estimated variation in the trip distribution, and formulate an accessibility to employment indicator for the different zones of the city. By comparing the results obtained with the two approaches, we are able to not only better assess the goodness of fit and the impact of this intervention, but also understand reasons for the systematic similarities and differences in their predictions.},

Most specifically we want to study the estimate of the O-D matrix obtained using observed link volumes for the class of proportional assignment methods. These methods are essentially the ones which do not take into account explicitly or implicitly any constraints of capacities. We show that for this class of method the estimation of the O-D matrix is equivalent to a linear regression problem. We discuss the problem of estimability of the parameters and relate this question with the sample of traffic volume needed. The discussion is illustrated by an example.},

In recent years, methodological advances have been made in the estimation of origin–destination matrices from disaggregate fare transaction and vehicle location data. Unlike manual origin–destination surveys, these methods provide nearly complete spatial and temporal coverage at minimal marginal cost. Early models inferred destinations on the basis of the proximity of possible destinations to the next origin and disregarded the effect of waiting time, in-vehicle time, and the number of transfers on path choice. The research reported here formulated a dynamic programming model that inferred destinations of public transportation trips on the basis of a generalized disutility minimization objective. The model inferred paths and transfers on multileg journeys and worked on systems that served a mix of gated stations and ungated stops. The model is being used to infer destinations of public transportation trips in Boston, Massachusetts, and is producing better results than could be obtained with earlier models.},

Three model components are involved: scaling vehicle trip-level origin?destination transfer data, measuring crowding as perceived by passengers through performance measures defined for this purpose, and determining the sources of crowding. The latter is important to identify the most effective means of addressing crowding in each case.

The goal of the paper is to describe in detail and demonstrate application of the methodology of OD matrix evaluation based on video recording and traffic counts done in the study area. The approbation of the methodology was done in Riga city in the area which covers part of few city districts. The study area was surrounded by the video recording devices. In the same time manual counting of the traffic was performed. Next the manual decoding of the video recording was performed, recording the type of the vehicle and licence plate number for each recording site with split on incoming and outgoing traffic. This gave the information about origin and destination transport zones of the traffic flow and allows to construct initial OD matrix. The evaluated initial OD matrix was used to estimate the probability matrix, which describes the probability of driving to the different destinations from the origin. The obtained updated OD matrix was calibrated based on TFlowFuzzy approach. The manual counting data were used for the calibration of OD matrix. Finally the OD matrix was manually checked by the group of experts. The proposed methodology allows to estimate the OD matrix, which could be used for microscopic traffic modelling in case of dynamic routing application in the model.},

  abstract = {Over 30~years have passed since activity-based travel demand models (ABMs) emerged to overcome the limitations of the preceding models which have dominated the field for over 50~years. Activity-based models are valuable tools for transportation planning and analysis, detailing the tour and mode-restricted nature of the household and individual travel choices. Nevertheless, no single approach has emerged as a dominant method, and research continues to improve ABM features to make them more accurate, robust, and practical. This paper describes the state of art and practice, including the ongoing ABM research covering both demand and supply considerations. Despite the substantial developments, ABM’s abilities in reflecting behavioral realism are still limited. Possible solutions to address this issue include increasing the inaccuracy of the primary data, improved integrity of ABMs across days of the week, and tackling the uncertainty via integrating demand and supply. Opportunities exist to test, the feasibility of spatial transferability of ABMs to new geographical contexts along with expanding the applicability of ABMs in transportation policy-making.},

It is claimed that the motivation for doing so is to help real-life transport planners use matrix estimation methods effectively, especially in terms of trading-off observational data with prior subjective input (typically referred to as 'professional judgement'). The paper lists a number of applications that require such methods, differentiating between relatively simple and highly complex applications. It is argued that a sound philosophical perspective is particularly important for estimating trip matrices in the latter type of application. As a result of this argument, a classification structure is built up through using concepts of realism, subjectivity, empiricism and rationalism. Emphasis is put on the fact that, in typical transport planning applications, none of these concepts is useful in its extreme form. The structure is then used to make a review of methods for estimating trip matrices using link counts, covering material published over the past 30 years.},

  abstract = {A growing number of researchers and transit agencies are using fare card and vehicle location data to infer passengers’ origins, destinations, and transfers. A number of researchers have suggested that these new data sets provide valuable information for transit network design, but few concrete applications have been developed to address bus network design and service planning problems. This paper proposes new service planning procedures to aggregate these automated data to examine travel patterns to specific locations of interest to propose needed improvements. The data from existing passengers’ trips are then analyzed to assess the benefits of the proposed service changes. In particular, the number of existing passengers who would likely experience shorter travel times with the service changes is calculated according to the geometry of how a proposed new or extended route intersects with the existing transit network. The results of this analysis provide planners with better information than is currently available to support decisions on how to allocate the scarce resources typically available for service changes. Several case studies from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority are presented to illustrate these analytical techniques.},

This research demonstrates the feasibility and ease of applying the trip-chaining method to infer bus passengers' boarding and alighting locations, and validates the results by comparing them with the Bus Passenger Origin and Destination (BODS) survey data in London. With the inferred OD matrices, the variations of weekday and weekend bus route OD patterns over a two-week period are examined for planning purposes. Given these variations, reliance on ADCS can provide transit planners with more comprehensive, reliable and correct information for service planning than traditional manual surveys. Moreover, while interchange conditions and performance are considered important inputs for public transit planning, collecting such data has not been easy. Based on the inferred OD matrices and the Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data, alighting times for bus passengers can also be estimated. As a result, bus journey stages can easily be linked to form complete journeys based on the difference between the subsequent trip's boarding time and the previous trip's alighting time for each bus passenger. By comparing the interchange time and the connecting bus route's headway, this research also provides a way to evaluate connecting bus services and bus passengers' interchange patterns. Finally, this research can be expanded to the full bus network and other travel modes, opening the door to developing more comprehensive data bases for use in intermodal network planning.},

  abstract = {Ride-hailing applications are becoming more and more popular for providing drivers and passengers with convenient ride services, especially in metropolises like Beijing or New York. To obtain the passengers’ mobility patterns, the online platforms of ride services need to predict the number of passenger demands from one region to another in advance. We formulate this problem as an Origin-Destination Matrix Prediction (ODMP) problem. Though this problem is essential to large-scale providers of ride services for helping them make decisions and some providers have already put it forward in public1, existing studies have not solved this problem well. One of the main reasons is that the ODMP problem is more challenging than the common demand prediction. Besides the number of demands in a region, it also requires the model to predict the destinations of them. In addition, data sparsity is a severe issue. To solve the problem effectively, we propose a unified model, Grid-Embedding based Multi-task Learning (GEML) which consists of two components focusing on spatial and temporal information respectively. The Grid-Embedding part is designed to model the spatial mobility patterns of passengers and neighboring relationships of different areas, the pre-weighted aggregator of which aims to sense the sparsity and range of data. The Multi-task Learning framework focuses on modeling temporal attributes and capturing several objectives of the ODMP problem. The evaluation of our model is conducted on real operational datasets from UCAR and Didi2. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our GEML against the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract = {In the field of transportation, the origin-destination matrix is one of the main and important components, especially in analyzing, planning, and managing a public transport network. The traditional survey can be used to determine passengers travel patterns and generate origin-destination matrix, but it is inefficient and cost a lot of resources. In the recent years, various methods have been studied to estimate origin-destination matrix to reduce costs and increase the accuracy of passengers flow. Many of them take advantages of big data technology to gather passengers travel information, mostly using smart card data. In this paper, we perform origindestination matrix estimation using information from the smart card that was collected from automatic fare collection systems in Jakarta’s Bus Rapid Transit. There are approximately 160 million records from 20 months of transactions between June 2014 and January 2016. This study utilized trip chaining algorithm that generates 610 daily OD matrices, 87 weekly OD matrices and 20 monthly OD matrices. The analysis is performed at a station and a line level, with an addition of passenger behavioral pattern.},

Three broad groups of models for such estimation have been identified. The first one assumes that trips follow a gravity type pattern and the problem is reduced to calibrating the parameters of such a model from the observed counts. Depending on the assumed form of the gravity model this technique leads to linear or non-linear regression solutions. The second group of models attempts to estimate the 0-D matrix through a network equilibrium approach based on Wardrop's first principle. The third group follows an entropy maximising approach in which the most likely trip matrix compatible with the observed flows is sought. Finally, the advantages of each approach are discussed and the most promising technique and areas of application are identified.},

  abstract = {Having accepted the need for the development of simpler and less cumbersome transport demand models, the paper concentrates on one possible line for simplification: estimation of trip matrices from link volume counts. Traffic counts are particularly attractive as a data basis for modelling because of their availability, low cost and nondisruptive character. It is first established that in normal conditions it may be possible to find more than one trip matrix which, when loaded onto a network, reproduces the observed link volumes. The paper then identifies three approaches to reduce this underspecification problem and produce a unique trip matrix consistent with the counts. The first approach consists of assuming that trip-making behaviour can be explained by a gravity model whose parameters can be calibrated from the traffic counts. Several forms of this gravity model have been put forward and they are discussed in Section 3. The second approach uses mathematical programming techniques associated to equilibrium assignment problems to estimate a trip matrix in congested areas. This method can also be supplemented by a special distribution model developed for small areas. The third approach relies on entropy and information theory considerations to estimate the most likely trip matrix consistent with the observed flows. A particular feature of this group is that they can include prior, perhaps outdated, information about the matrix.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement of information and communication technology has brought a revolution in the domain of public transport (PT) planning alongside other areas of transport planning and operations. Of particular significance are the passively generated big data sources (e.g., smart cards, detailed vehicle location data, mobile phone traces, social media) which have started replacing the traditional surveys conducted onboard, at the stops/stations and/or at the household level for gathering insights about the behavior of the PT users. This paper presents a systematic review of the contemporary research papers related to the use of novel data sources in PT planning with particular focus on (1) assessing the usability and potential strengths and weaknesses of different emerging big data sources, (2) identifying the challenges and highlighting research gaps. Reviewed articles were categorized based on qualitative pattern matching (similarities/dissimilarities) and multiple sources of evidence analysis under three categories—use of big data in (1) travel pattern analysis, (2) PT modelling, and (3) PT performance assessment. The review revealed research gaps ranging from methodological and applied research on fusing different forms of big data as well as big data and traditional survey data; further work to validate the models and assumptions; lack of progress on developing more dynamic planning models. Findings of this study could inform transport planners and researchers about the opportunities/challenges big data bring for PT planning. Harnessing the full potential of the big data sources for PT planning can be extremely useful for cities in the developing world, where the PT landscape is changing more rapidly, but traditional forms of data are expensive to collect.},

  abstract = {New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) has put into production a ridership application that determines surface transit boarding and alighting locations for each one of approximately 2.8 million daily passenger trips on 218 bus routes, to support bus service scheduling and planning. The application combines data from an Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) system, a multimodal entry-only non-geographic Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system, and General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) schedule file streams. To accomplish this, NYCTA developed a highly optimized network generation tool to estimate bus boarding/alighting locations and link loads, by creating a scaled-down custom network based on first-bus trajectory (from AVL boarding location data) and a few possible AFC/AVL-inferred second-leg pickup stops. Solving for the shortest walking path on this sub-network yields connection and alighting points much more efficiently than solving for all 128 million potential O/D pairs systemwide. The program executes in less than three hours in an automated environment, which can support operations management’s needs for next-day reporting as well as the monitoring of patterns and trends in ridership behavior. It also allows multiple days of route-level program output to be aggregated for schedule making purposes, providing a significantly more representative understanding of passenger loads that were historically obtained from a few labor-intensive on-board observations (ridechecks) collected over a multi-year period. Results were validated and found to be consistent with manual ridechecks, limited O/D surveys, and others. Obtained accuracy was sufficient to achieve acceptance of AVL-AFC data in lieu of traditional on-board observations for NYCTA schedule making.},

One study proposes an enhanced method of inferring the rail trip OD matrix from an origin-only AFC system to replace the routine passenger survey. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the pattern of a person's consecutive transit trip segments. In particular the study examines the rail-to-bus case (which is ignored by prior studies) by integrating AFC and AVL data and utilizing GIS and DBMS technologies. A software tool is developed to facilitate the implementation of the algorithm. The other study is of rail path choice, which employs the Logit and Mixed Logit models to examine revealed public transit riders' travel behavior based on the inferred OD matrix and the transit network attributes. This study is based on two data sources: the rail trip OD matrix inferred in the first case study and the attributes of alternative paths calculated from a network representation in Trans CAD. This study demonstrates that a rigorous traveler behavior analysis can be performed based on the data source from ADC systems. Both cases illustrate the potential as well as the difficulty of utilizing these systems and more importantly demonstrate that at relatively low marginal cost, ADC systems can provide transit agencies with a rich information source to support decision making.

  abstract = {Abstract: Automatic data collection (ADC) systems are becoming increasingly common in transit systems throughout the world. Although these ADC systems are often designed to support specific fairly narrow functions, the resulting data can have wide-ranging application, well beyond their design purpose. This article illustrates the potential that ADC systems can provide transit agencies with new rich data sources at low marginal cost, as well as the critical gap between what ADC systems directly offer and what is needed in practice in transit agencies. To close this gap requires data processing and analysis methods with support of technologies such as database management systems (DBMS) and geographic information systems (GIS). This research presents a case study of the automatic fare collection (AFC) system of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) rail system and develops a method for inferring rail passenger trip origin-destination (OD) matrices from an origin-only AFC system to replace expensive passenger OD surveys. A software tool is developed to facilitate the method implementation and the results of the application in CTA are reported.},

  abstract = {Planning models require consideration of travelers with distinct attributes (value of time (VOT), willingness to pay, travel budgets, etc.) and behavioral preferences (e.g., willingness to switch routes with potential savings) in a differentiated market (where routes have varying tolls and levels of service). This paper proposes to explicitly model the formation and spreading of spatial knowledge among travelers, following cognitive map theory. An agent-based route choice (ARC) model was developed to track choices of each individual decision-maker in a road network over time and map individual choices into macroscopic flow pattern. ARC has been applied to both the Sioux Falls and Chicago sketch networks. Comparisons between ARC and existing models (user equilibrium (UE) and stochastic user equilibrium (SUE)) on both networks show ARC is valid and computationally tractable. In brief, this paper specifically focuses on the route choice behavior, while the proposed model can be extended to other modules of transportation planning under an integrated framework.},
