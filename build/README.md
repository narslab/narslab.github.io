# NARS Lab

## Build site

To build the website locally, clone the repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/narslab/narslab.github.io.git
```

Then install necessary Ruby dependencies by running `bundle install` from within the `narslab.github.io` directory.  After this, the site can be be built with:

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

To view the site, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and point a browser to `http://localhost:4000/`.  More information on Jekyll can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).

To include projects, preprocessing scripts are necessary to clone project repos and update Jekyll metadata. This can be accomplished with:

```
ruby _scripts/update-and-preprocess.rb
```

Then `jekyll build` works as normal.

## Contribute

Blog posts just require YAML top matter that looks something like:

```
---
layout: post
title: A brief history of complexity science
author: Jimi Oke
link: URL
image: /images/blog/IAMGE.png
---
```

The `layout`, `title` and `author` tags are required, while `link` and `image` are optional.  Just save a Markdown file with this top matter as something like `blog/_posts/2020-09-14-history-complexity.md`, where `2020-09-14` is the date of the post and `history-complexity` is the short title.  This short title is used in the URL of the post, so this becomes `blog/history-complexity/`.
The short title should be therefore be unique to avoid conflicts.
