I am a first-year masterâ€™s student in the Business & Analytics program in the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In Spring 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering also from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research focus is on developing an interpretable machine learning framework that can accurately predict energy usage in clusters of buildings, such as a college campus.
