I am an assistant professor in the [Civil and Environmental Engineering](http://cee.umass.edu/) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral associate at the [Intelligent Transportation Systems Lab](https://its.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from 2016 through 2019.
I obtained my PhD in Civil Engineering from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/) in 2016.
My research interests are in advancing network science and machine learning for discovery and problem-solving towards accessibility, resilience and sustainability in the built environment.
Currently, my domain lies chiefly at the intersection of transportation, energy and the environment.
