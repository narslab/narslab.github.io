Despite the growing awareness of environmental and safety impacts of fuel transfer, such as emissions, spills and other harmful effects, existing energy models for various types of networks are yet to fully capture modal distinctions which are relevant to providing pathways to limiting these impacts. To address this deficit in detailed multimodal analyses, we have built on recent work to develop a partial-equilibrium model that incorporates the representation of multimodal fuel transfer within energy networks. In a novel application to the North American crude oil market, we also demonstrate that our model is a useful tool for exploring avenues for reducing the risks of light and heavy crude oil transportation across this region. The results we obtain indicate that a combined strategy of rail loading restrictions, pipeline deployments and a discontinuation of the oil export ban is most effective in reducing the transportation of crude oil by rail and thereby mitigating the associated risks.","2019-06-01","2020-04-28 07:25:10","2020-04-28 07:25:10","2020-04-28 07:25:10","521-555","","2","19","","Netw Spat Econ","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/jbo/Zotero/storage/5KQUXZBV/Oke et al. - 2019 - Multimodal Transportation Flows in Energy Networks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the context of multi-agent simulation technology, the state-of-the-art lacks a platform that captures the dynamics between decentralized driver decision-making and the centralized coordinated decision-making. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing a comprehensive framework that models various facets of MoD, namely heterogeneous MoD driver decision-making and coordinated fleet management within SimMobility, an agent- and activity-based demand model integrated with a dynamic multi-modal network assignment model. To facilitate such a study, we propose an event-based modeling framework. Behavioral models were estimated to characterize the decision-making of drivers using a GPS dataset from a major MoD fleet operator in Singapore. The proposed framework was designed to accommodate behaviors of multiple on-demand services such as traditional MoD, Lyft-like services, and automated MoD (AMoD) services which interact with traffic simulators and a multi-modal transportation network. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework through a large-scale case study in Singapore comparing the fully decentralized traditional MoD with the future AMoD services in a realistic simulation setting. We found that AMoD results in a more efficient service even with increased demand. Parking strategies and fleet sizes will also have an effect on user satisfaction and network performance.","2019-12-01","2020-04-28 07:24:41","2020-04-28 07:24:41","2020-04-28 07:24:41","15-29","","12","2673","","Transportation Research Record","From Traditional to Automated Mobility on Demand","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ownership is one factor affecting bicycle usage, but work is still ongoing to not only quantify its effects but also to understand patterns in its growth and influence. In recent work, we mined and discovered patterns in global bicycle ownership that showed the existence of four characteristic country groups and their trends. Building on these results, we show in this paper that the ownership dataset can be modeled as a network. First, we observe mixing tendencies that indicate neighboring countries are more likely to be in the same ownership group and we map the likelihoods for cross-group mixings. Further, we define the strength of connections between countries by their proximity in ownership levels. We then determine the weighted degree assortative coefficient for the network and for each group relative to the network. We find that while the weighted degree assortativity of the ownership network is statistically insignificant, the highest and lowest ownership groups exhibit disassortative behavior with respect to the entire network. The second and third ranked groups, however, are strongly assortative. Our model serves as a step toward further work in studying the relationship between proximity and bicycle ownership among nations and unearthing possible patterns of influence. Considering further developments, this work can inform policy-relevant recommendations toward regional planning.

To facilitate effective planning for current and future needs, a framework is required that provides important consumption metrics and also explains the various contributors to energy consumption, along with their interactions. To address this gap, we estimated models that utilized operational and ridership data for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority?s rapid transit system, as well as ambient temperature, to accurately predict system-wide electricity consumption. The models were trained with data from 2019 and tested with data from 2020. The estimated multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models explained 93% and 95% of the variance in the data set, respectively. The MLR model provided predictions with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.7?MWh and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.68%, while the RF model resulted in an RMSE of 2.94?MWh and MAPE of 5.01%. We also investigated the impacts of COVID-19 on the transit system by exploring the effects on ridership, energy consumption, cost, and train movement metrics before and during the pandemic.

To fill this gap, we analyze the equity implications of Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) in three full-scale prototype cities using SimMobility, a state-of-the-art activity- and agent-based framework. The prototype cities were developed based on two auto-dependent typologies, representing cities largely in the US/Canada, and a dense transit-oriented typology. We perform equity analyses at the individual and income-group level, in order to reveal the winners and losers from the introduction of AVs under two scenarios: (1) AMoD Intro, in which a low-cost AMoD service competes with mass transit, and (2) AMoD Transit Integration, where AMoD complements mass transit, via access/egress connectivity service to rapid transit stations. We evaluate the following outcomes: induced demand by age and income groups, mode share by income levels, individual kilometers traveled by different modes and income levels, and the spatial distribution of change in fare and accessibility. Outcomes are considered as equity-oriented if they reduce accessibility gaps, particularly among disadvantaged populations. Our results indicate that in large population-dense and transit-oriented cities, the most equity-oriented outcomes can be achieved, due to extensive mass transit usage, which depresses car usage and restricts induced demand for AMoD. Such cities provide greater opportunities for low-income groups. Specifically, the AMoD Transit Integration scenario results in the best outcomes and implies a new market share, as disadvantaged groups, such as children and low-income individuals, were able to travel more using the integrated AMoD-transit service. Nevertheless, in car-dependent cities, where accessibility gaps are much larger, AMoD Intro scenario performs better compared to AMoD Transit Integration, as it serves the less accessible population and significantly improves their opportunities.","2021-12-01","2023-01-19 01:46:45","2023-01-19 01:46:45","2023-01-19 01:46:45","92-107","","","154","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","Who benefits from AVs?","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/jbo/Zotero/storage/YL5I7TKZ/S0965856421002469.html","","","Simulation; Accessibility; Equity; Automated Mobility-on-Demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The geometry data of this paper were collected from passenger tracks with a length of 155 miles from 2011 to 2020. In addition to geometry data, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data were used as additional explanatory variables to improve the performance of models.

Results indicate that the GBM outperforms logistic regression and can successfully predict YDNI with a very high sensitivity of 0.94. Parametric analysis indicated the direct correlation between the Ballast Fouling Index (BFI) and the probability of defect occurrence.

However, the current modeling frameworks have a significant gap in that they are not demand- and congestion-responsive, nor are they capable of modeling the system-wide energy consumption of bus fleets at the vehicle-level, encompassing all three types of powertrains—conventional, hybrid, and electric. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive modeling framework that takes into account passenger loading, considers the dynamics of the system including acceleration, and is capable of predicting the real-time energy usage of each bus in a transit network. Using the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority system as a case study, we calibrated existing powertrain-specific models for conventional diesel, hybrid, and battery electric buses. Our demand- and congestion-responsive energy consumption modeling framework fills this critical gap and offers significant potential for future sustainable transportation planning. Relying on detailed trajectories computed from one month of bus location data, along with passenger counts and road grade, our framework is a novel contribution in that it provides spatiotemporal energy predictions for an entire bus system. As it is readily calibrated with potential improvements in accuracy given more data, this framework can be applied by transit agencies for the purposes of real-time energy consumption monitoring, fleet electrification planning, equity analyses, and carbon emission reduction strategies.","2024-01-01","2024-06-18 14:43:24","2024-06-18 14:43:24","2024-06-18 14:43:24","707-720","","1","2678","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/home/jbo/Zotero/storage/APQISQDZ/Arabi and Oke - 2024 - Comprehensive Energy Modeling Framework for Multi-.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A complex rail transit network serves the Boston metropolitan area, U.S., which costs $38 million for the 422 GWh of system electricity consumed annually. With the aim of developing a tool for energy and cost reduction decision support, we propose a comprehensive machine learning framework to investigate line-specific contributions to energy. This effort builds on prior work in estimating a system-wide energy model for the Boston network. By introducing line-specific train movement and operation variables, we obtain a higher-performing model  (R2=0.91) . Furthermore, the model better explains the relationship between energy and train movement, ridership, and weather variables. Most importantly, the model facilitates analyses of how each line contributes to system consumption at the hour level. We found that the non-line-specific variables made a contribution of −2.7% to the average hourly energy of consumption of −5.4 MWh with a baseline energy consumption of 39 MWh. The Red Line dominates the energy consumption among line-specific variables, contributing 2.3% to the hourly average.

The objective of this research was to develop a methodology for accurately classifying high-risk crash locations. The hypothesis of this study was that readily obtained roadway indicators can be used along with machine learning techniques to categorize locations as high crash-risk. A database containing 5,383 locations was created during 2012 to 2015 as part of the Hellenic National Road Safety Project and used to develop three binary machine learning models to classify high crash-risk locations based on roadway indicators. The three models were random forest, gradient boosting, and extra trees. This research used features engineering to reduce the number of indicators in the model, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique to address imbalances in the dataset between the minority (high crash-risk locations identified using crash reports) and majority classes (medium to low crash-risk locations identified based on local police testimonies, site inspections, and geometry analysis). Although all three models performed similarly, the extra trees model outperformed the other two on a range of performance metrics, including the area under the precision–recall curve and the F1-score. The findings revealed that design speeds, pavement markings, signage presence, and pavement condition were the most influential factors affecting roadway safety. The contribution of this research is in the development of a transferable methodology for classifying high crash-risk locations in addition to revealing key indicators for crash-risk potential, which in turn can inform cost-effective data collection and maintenance activities.","2024-01-07","2024-06-18 14:45:11","2024-06-18 14:45:11","2024-06-18 14:45:11","03611981231217497","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","/home/jbo/Zotero/storage/IAF4WTY9/Sarigiannis et al. - 2024 - Feature Engineering and Decision Trees for Predict.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modeling and field-testing efforts are demonstrating that shared mobility coupled with AV technology for automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) service may significantly impact levels of service and environmental outcomes in future cities. Given these rapidly emerging developments, there is an urgent need for methods to adequately quantify the economic impacts of new vehicle technologies and future urban mobility policy. In this paper, we show how broader user-centric impacts can be captured by the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, which takes advantage of the rich data and outcomes of utility-maximization activity-based models and its interaction with mesoscale agent-based traffic simulation frameworks. Using the SimMobility simulator, we evaluate shared AMoD strategies applied to a Singapore micromodel city testbed. A near-future strategy of exclusive availability of AMoD service in the central business district (CBD), and a further-horizon strategy of the full operation of AMoD city-wide in the absence of other on-demand services, were tested and evaluated. Our results provide insights into the income and accessibility effects on the population under the implementation of shared and automated mobility policies. The outcomes indicate that the city-wide deployment of AMoD results in greater accessibility and network performance. Moreover, the accessibility of low-income individuals is improved relative to that of mid- and high-income individuals. The restriction of AMoD to the CBD along with the operation of other on-demand services, however, provides a certain level of disbenefit to segments of the population in two exceptional cases. The first is to high-income individuals who live in a suburban zone and rely heavily on on-demand services; the second is to mid-income residents that have excellent public transportation coverage with close proximity to the CBD. We further establish the efficacy of the ABA measure, as these findings motivate the need for measuring socioeconomic impacts at the individual level. The work presented here serves as a foundation for policy evaluation in real-world urban models for future mobility paradigms.","2021-08-01","2024-06-26 19:28:59","2024-06-26 19:28:59","2024-06-26 19:28:58","1613-1638","","4","48","","Transportation","Evaluating the impacts of shared automated mobility on-demand services","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/jbo/Zotero/storage/T7BAVJBH/Nahmias-Biran et al. - 2021 - Evaluating the impacts of shared automated mobilit.pdf","","","Agent-based modeling; Simulation; Accessibility; Automated mobility on-demand; Autonomous vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents a model that utilizes operational and ridership data for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's rapid transit system, as well as ambient temperature, to accurately predict system-wide electricity consumption. Linear regression and random forests were used to estimate energy consumption, which could explain a 0.93 and 0.95 variance in the data set, respectively. The model was trained with data from 2019 and tested with data from 2020. The linear regression model provided predictions with RMSE of 2.7 MWh and MAPE of 4.68%, and the random forest model resulted in a RMSE of 2.94 MWh and MAPE of 5.01%.

We then generate and simulate two auto-dependent (largely US-specific) prototype cities via a state-of-the-art agent-based platform, SimMobility, for integrated demand microsimulation and supply mesoscopic simulation. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing the impacts of automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) implementation strategies in the cities based on demand, congestion, energy consumption and emissions outcomes. Our results show that the introduction of AMoD cannibalizes mass transit while increasing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and congestion. In sprawling auto-dependent cities with low transit penetration, the congestion and energy consumption effects under best-case assumptions are similar regardless of whether AMoD competes with or complements mass transit. In dense auto-dependent cities with moderate transit modeshare, the integration of AMoD with transit yields better outcomes in terms of VKT and congestion. Such cities cannot afford to disinvest in mass transit, as this would result in unsustainable outcomes. Overall, this framework can provide insights into how AMoD can be sustainably harnessed not only in low-density and high-density auto-dependent cities, but also in other typologies.","2020-10-01","2024-08-12 18:16:05","2024-08-12 18:16:05","2024-08-12 18:16:05","98-126","","","140","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/jbo/Zotero/storage/5QN43HV5/Oke et al. - 2020 - Evaluating the systemic effects of automated mobil.pdf; /home/jbo/Zotero/storage/32I2ZKEP/S0965856420306327.html","","","Agent-based simulation; Automated mobility-on-demand; Future urban mobility; Prototype cities; Urban typologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, regional transit systems, accounting for 60% of transit systems in the United States, are often not equipped with smart card systems that are typically needed for trip chaining due to the high costs involved. This study introduces an innovative trip chaining framework that leverages boarding-only mobile ticketing automated fare collection (AFC) data. Our approach incorporates spatiotemporal passenger types obtained via typology analysis. This is followed by calibrating type-specific and season-aware parameters using survey data supplied by the network operators. We then trained a gradient boosting machine to learn the error structure of the initial trip chaining flow estimates and augment final trip frequency predictions. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating spatial error correction significantly improves the trip chaining results. However, the best performance is achieved when season-awareness and typology information are integrated with spatial error correction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) by approximately 70% and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) by 85%. Furthermore, the typology, which we validate with a classification model, provides a deeper understanding of passenger travel characteristics which can facilitate further planning efforts. The spatial error correction model also provides insights into portions of the network that can be better targeted for survey data collection and mobile ticketing adoption to improve future models. Overall, this research will enable regional transit planners to efficiently utilize limited resources and generate valuable insights that would otherwise remain inaccessible.","2024-09-06","2024-09-30 18:20:03","2024-09-30 18:20:03","2024-09-30 18:20:03","19","","3","6","","Data Sci.
