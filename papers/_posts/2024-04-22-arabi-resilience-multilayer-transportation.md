# Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive review of resilience concepts, methodologies, metrics, and modeling techniques, and identifies key research gaps. These include the lack of multilayer network representations of transportation infrastructures when quantifying resilience, and insufficient metrics for assessing equitable outcomes. To address these gaps, we propose a conceptual multilayer framework for transporttaion infrastructure networks and develop equitable resilience metrics that incorporate socioeconomic and demographic variables. Using Pioneer Valley as a case study, we apply our framework to assess the resilience of transportation networks and demonstrate its utility in guiding resource allocation to enhance both the physical robustness and social equity of infrastructure. Our findings show that this approach significantly contributes to more informed and inclusive decision-making, fostering the development of resilient and equitable urban environments.
